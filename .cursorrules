When a year is mentioned, it is in the format of xxxx yy, where x is the year, yy is the reckoning
Date reckoning can be either PF or AI. PF is counted in the negative direction, like real-world BC/BCE. AI is like AD/CE
For age calculations, or relative dates, current year is 1275 AI
when asked for your opinion, offer criticism first before agreeing
when asked for information, a conversant style is preferred
when asked to generate markdown, be mindful of markdown linting rules. 80 columns unless things like links break, underscores preferred for emphasis
.md files use commonmark linting rules, links are in Zola format
external references in OntoLex-Lemon .jsonld documents should be in the form of a link to the page in the external site, see Zola config in site/config.toml
