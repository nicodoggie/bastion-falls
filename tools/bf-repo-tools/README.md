# kanka2md-migrator

Rough miscellany database HTML to markdown migrator.

Might not even really fix this to be general purpose, but likely this will be some one-off. Who knows tho :D

Wrote this to move my stuff from some old version of the [Kanka](https://github.com/owlchester/kanka) codebase that I self-hosted into a static site made from [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).
