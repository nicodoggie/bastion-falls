The main river on \[location:98|Raibon Island\]. It bisects the island almost equally in a north-south direction. It sources its water primarily from the \[location:305\] and various springs and stream stemming from the \[new:location|Montrabar mountain range, as well as in-flows from the surrounding seas. Because of these inflows, its water is mostly brackish, and therefore not a potable water source for the island.
