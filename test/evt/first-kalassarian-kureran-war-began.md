After nearly a century of close contact, communication adn cooperatiobn between the old Republic of the Kalassus, now styled the \[new:organization:Kalassarian Empire\], and the Kurerans of Korad, war broke out.

The Kurerans no longer wanted to conduct trade with the empire, due to its growing expansionist agenda. The Kalassarians were using Kureran magical devices to fuel it, and the Kurerans no longer wanted anything to do with them.
