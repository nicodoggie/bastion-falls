Hags of Strega
If she is on her way to Reynoso, then perhaps she is looking for Hags of Hama
They have access to the known universe, the deep lore, all knowledge, every mind in the world has access in the deep lore, growing older as I age most people has a small opening in their mind, a tiny fragment that is possible to be seen to be understood about the deep lore
I am student, I have a door opening to the occult, Hags of Hama are able to open the door but also travel through it
I heard voices inside my head
Why are you helping me?
I might be trusted
Even if she help me to point me to Hama
It is no easy task
Not even a guarantee that they still are alive and active
Different covens and they have their own.
Females of the species have a connection to the rithma
The Hama they chose not to show themselves to them
She is willing to send someone with me
Lore of the Hexblood is unknown to them
Progeny of the essence of one of us
Injected to my Mother’s womb
Blood of Hags
I could become one
Becoming a hag is a choice
A wholeheartedly choice, a taste of what would it be like to be a Hag
Little ones - They are those who are child-like, children who has mind that was given access of the deep lore, thought of actualize of feats of magnificent, they are able to listen to the rhythms of deep lore and give them form
Rithma, these symbols given as a guide
Confusing

He thinks the yeti is his savior
He can’t be a burden to this person give him some sort of a ration but he never found this place ever again
He didn’t say anything

What is a hag - a Hag is a group of women who have discovered a means of getting access to rithma through the natural process of the body. Create life or to sustain life to her body.
Women can take control of our body, are able to convert our own, instead gestating children, gestating nuggets of energy.
Coven - a group of women, derived from the word called covenant, formed a pact with each other.

Hags of Strega - I search for the hags of hama, 

A coven of women, claiming that they are hags of hama, the thing is that they don’t seem conformed
They don’t get a lot of people in this land who are open with their religion.
The fake hags of hama could be reformist church
They don’t openly show that they enjoy pain
Island where Raenoso resides
Raibon island - second largest island
If I to search to this place
Hexblood - the egg that she gave birth to

His Family use to live in the border of poasah, those parts of the border sometimes, during campaigns, take possessions of their lands, when the armies, the captains or nobility uncle and young children taken by a noble men, they made them run and hide, in the middle of the woods and his noblemen hunted them down, before war.
It hasn’t been formalize, the poasahn are showing their aggression towards them.
Hags of Hama - A current group that’s there, they've been operating for 2 yrs ago, sending women to the streets of raibon, basically doing what he do, spying on people.

These women don’t seem to be Seneran, embed themselves to seneran ships, chambermaid

Deep lore, is actually true

Hags of Hama have spies

They captured spies, they don’t talk, they smirk, very good in terms of espionage, training, the only reasons they know they are spies bec of their journal.
La Camaraderie doesn't have any access with Magic or people with magic, they recruit people with magic.

La camaraderie, don't know the extent of my abilities, the amount of knowledge about infiltration, useful as back-up
Island off the coast in senera, a prison island called The Gullet in the middle of a river browns.

Hedwig feels magic trickled down to her body when she wears the rings
Pure white dress, somewhat sheer
Masra at the moment
Hobar
Cotto pulls down the cloak revealing his face and self
Hobar, crowned prince of strega
History books, long time ago a separate kingdom, apgar isn't even 
He disappeared, supposed to be get married, raenoso was newly discovered, it was actually called raebon was hobar’s brother
Masra
Hobar was sailed to raenoso, he was to marry the princess Karni of anasae, and he sailed to leave but his ship was never to be found
His ship sunk
What happen to Princess Karni, He doesn’t know
She is happily married to his younger brother
Anasai and Strega had fallen to war after this
Masra is a hag of strega, she is a commoner
Mishke - Masra’s mother
He purchased the wedding band from a v famous jeweler named “Tybor of Karalos” Hedwig heard from more historical accounts, He founded a company, eventually made the crowned jewels of Strega when that is commissioned by one of the descendants of Hobar about a century later
Imbued magic with objects
It was a forced kiss, it is not me
Books doesn’t reference Rithma
History of Strega, Stories of Stregan nobility
Hobar - crowned Prince Hobar, his father, Stregan nobility book
Heart beat faster whenever she get close to one of the men
954 AI reign of Hobar’s Father name of Hobar’s father : King Hudor of Strega
Younger brother Raebon, Sister Sarah, Sister Anisa
Crowned prince Hobar - his biggest contribution to the society is he was a patron of the arts, stregan art society, stregan society of dance, stregan orchestra, he dedicated his time to that. At the age of 10, He was arranged to be married to Princess Karni Anasai as was promised in the earlier treaty of Senera, year 959
The treaty is to settle a peace between strega and anasai, first anasai stregan war
Kind Hudor’s father
Prince Raibon refused to marry Karni which angered the anasaians which leads to second ansaian war 
Breaking friendship of strega and anasai
Continuing of feud
Eventual formation of Apgar society
Hags of Strega, lead by Atroya she said that they've been active for 100 years , 1175 100 yrs ago, 1-200 yrs before that
Vague reasons
Hobar died
Raibon doesn’t want to marry Karni
Mazra thinks Somme is a man who is called Strandiz
Strandiz - He is commander of the guard of Karni, he was the one who had called Mazra, paying Mazra and promising Mazra that he will not only get her Mother out of being a Hag, and bring me to the mountain and give me everything I want. I hear coming from Strandiz
Mazra is Delusional, Did he fall for you, all we have to do is to get him to the ship. This union, unholy union, strega cannot be the dominant power of anasai, princess karni is not assertive enough to be a co ruler
Strandiz
Unholy union of strega and anazai
Strandiz seem familiar
Recently read something with the name of Strandiz
Events of the first anazaian stregan war
There was a general strandiz who had lost and died in the battle of hedina court
Strandiz lead the forces of army to hedena court to eastern front, they had maneuvered, he was at vanguard leading them forward while his two sons
Leading  the wings, two attack pincer attacks to capture the army of anazaian force
Strandiz is anazaian
They're supposed to encircle the stregan force
The stregan force was a mere decoy they're just a 100 men out of a thousand
The stregans released their true force, cavalry and infantry attack that came from the north and south end of hedina court
Mazra refers to him as just Strandiz
Matthew Strandiz
How old he was around the conflict
945
Strandiz can be in Kingsguard
Position that was given to an aging military commander
Tell the captain to search for his ship wreckage
Search boat
Cursed trinkets
Hobar
Consecrated water
Sierre isn’t authorized to marry
“Descent into pleasure” starts with a rich daughter of a merchant, come of age recently, she is in coming of age party, she was discussing to her friends about their romantic life, never been kissed or never been touched, telling salacious stories heard from their nannies or governess or from lowborn chambermaids
Laina, found herself scandalized but somewhat excited, intrigued
She comes from a devout religious family, her parents are devout and humble. Angel of Humility 
They have gotten a governess and butler to ensure her life is pure
Whenever she asks one of the women around them they kinda brush her off or afraid they would say something
Escape her house, dressing up as commoner begins to form relationships with young carriage driver
She became addicted to the pleasure
Somme already discussing the search with Captain
Dom said he transformed once (Cotto) he was looking for Mazra
He told him he’s already that he tempted the gods today
Magic missile the ring
I hurt my hand with 1
The ring is completely unharmed
Return being Mazra and I see him as one of my very regular customer John
John is Mazra’s regular customer
It’s definitely similar to shrieking shop
It’s improper
Deepthroat
Cursed trinket
John, getting john as a customer
Escort business
They aren’t supposed to go to Raibon they're heading to ahuria
Mazra. Concerned by the fact that were heading to Ahuria, I know that Strandiz told me that they are supposed to meet me in an island
Ruining our happiness
Strandiz, what do you know about him? He was some son of General who died from nothing battle
He is acting on his whims as if he was given an out to a responsibility
He’s always been the one to did things right
Princess Karni, she is unartistic, speaks only about politics, uninterested to him
She can deal with all the political things, women can rule
A cave
Hedwig and somme fought a drowned spirit of Hobar
Darkness surrounded the area slowly goes away
Parts of some holes
Near the edge of this cavern unlike ours
Ruined and damage
It seems like it crashed
Treasures inside
As we walk near the ship
This is their meeting place
Strandiz
Hedwig thinks this man Somme, is very experienced
Mazra didn't want anything to do with Hobar
Used a letter opener to strike Hobar
“Strandiz”
She was on the deck she was running
She was blown off
After the tragedy, Hedwig will spend a few nights writing a play for these characters inspired by the tragedy and betrayal, the story of Prince Cobar (Hobar) and Hag Marzia (Mazra); she changed some of the names.
Hedwig also starts to write a journal about her late coming of age and late introduction to sexual pleasure, she writes about her feelings about pleasure, her desires and what's mostly on her mind.
Hedwig feels like this expedition made her realize that she has little self control about a lot of things, heated discussions, her temper about simple things like food which made her irrational causing her to hurt one of her Friends, Cotto.
Hedwig spends her free time writing these things, to share the experience with her Mother or peers back in Nura.

It does not require attunement, it is a property of magical items, if an item requires attunement I have to spend a night, communing to an item, giving some bit of my energy to it, activating or resonating with my body.
The rings are cursed, they seem to be soaked in negative energy, despair and negative emotions. Encoded with memories of two people.
Everytime a pair of people wears these rings, they will replay or experience the memories of those whose thoughts have come to them. The gems aren’t magical but they’re cut in such a way for the emotions to infuse it.
End of the visions, creatures that are a representation of the couple or fragments of soul will appear, they will attempt to kill the wearers.

Next Session goals for Hedwig :

Take back the signet ring, give it back to Somme (?)
Investigate Simbal’s dead body
In the morning, Investigate more about the Hags of Hama
Location is the Massage parlor that Dom frequented
What Hedwig knows about the Hags of Hama so far:
- Papa Simbal said that these Hags of Hama are women who can do real magic.
- It’s possible that these women killed Papa Simbal (Poison via Blowgun needle? Magic? Curse?) we have to find out!
- Hedwig learned about the Hags recruitment in the bog
	- Two girls from the Massage parlor went there thrice (Irene and Sheila)
	- Dom is very familiar with all the women at the Massage parlor

What makes the current Hags of Hama Fake:

20 yrs ago, Hedwig parents travel to Raenoso, Bain and Karen Rosenkrantz, disguised as a couple who wanted Children
Unicorn said that they both got in contact with the Hags of Hama and they made an arrangement with them and Hedwig is the result of that arrangement.
Why did Hedwig’s parents go to these people even though the story said they weren't sighted for the past 300-500 yrs?
Hedwig’s father is the Duke of Nura, he gathered information from reliable sources and even made an effort to travel to Raenoso for this
Hedwig said she tried asking them about it but they seem to can’t remember it anymore. 
Hexblood can only be made by real hags
The Hags of Hama are corrupted by these Reformist’s church

Details of the mission : He was part of the mission, they think that they are at fault, if rumors are true.
What are the rumors : An operation to raid seneran vessels, a daughter of duke, west manx, a place in seneran. They’re trying to get the seneran woman to take hostage. Captain of the crew said it's bad business or risky. Somme was part of the crew. They're trying to convince them that it’s a bad idea. 
The decision was overridden, and some other crew dealt with it.

Hedwig made amends with Somme and they continue with their lewd activities.

Goals for the Next Session:

Cotto, Dom and Somme will follow us behind.
Arrange a meeting with the Council through Justus.
Ask around for boat prices, upkeep and how to manage one. Name the boat “Rozenmaiden”

Session:

Narmaya could be a creature called “Vampire”. Immortal creatures that don’t age.
Cotto told about a part of vampire lore, about an abandoned mansion inhabited by a vampire. The man wasn’t a vampire but a man who lost his family, a hermit. When Cotto was there in the mansion, he borrowed books about vampires from that Man. 
What are vampires? Certain conditions to turn someone into a vampire. Highly intelligent undead, deep emotional feeling that their soul had latched on upon death like the poltergeist, Vampires retain their memories and their lives.
The first thing she did was latched on to Hedwig and drank her blood.
Hedwig casted “Detect magic” while scouting.
Hedwig detects a magical book with a grey aura. Looks like a tome, porpolisian
Some of the books in this room are Old kalasar
Somme and Dom are both acting weird, Somme called me “My Lady”
Hedwig found a skeleton key that opens a chest which contains magical items
Hedwig figured out that this box can hide magical items.
Magical items: 3 distinct colors
Scepter with a ruby gem (Red aura)
A blue robe that has a gold thread made for a woman (Transparent aura)
A bead embedded in a broach that has a gold chain (White aura)
Non-magical items inside : couple of dresses, hooded lantern
Hedwig touches the leather of the book and inside is old kalasarian note it says “Be wary dear reader of servants undertow they may be such creatures in which trust is for show, this book will hello to ensure their respect for if you will read they will sure do their deed”
The other end of this book Hedwig sees “If you wish to keep them keep your voice clear, if you wish to dispense them you must give them clear notice and say “You are dismissed””
Captain’s quarter : A Map on vellum, damaged by water. Senera, Sanari and parts of estrega pre 1100, some bottles of wine, sealed, unlabel, bottles of whiskey, and a bottle with a model ship inside “The Grey Haven”. (a place in a sailor’s legend, they go there after death”, a rusted saber, a mirror.
The magical book could immediately gain servants
Hedwig and Somme stripped down to their butt
Ceramic figurines, one of them is magical (has faint green aura)
Magical figurine shaped like a Nun of divine masochist
The other figurines looks like poasahn, they seem to depict northern poasahn.
The nun’s legs are detachable, can be twisted, inside is a marble. (marble is magical) the pale green aura means abjuration, related with healing. White marble with green aura.
Hedwig puts back the nun and took the magical marble
Hedwig talks about co-owning a ship with Somme
People who have potential to be in my crew
Somme
Dom - Deckhand
Cotto - Lookout (Seats in the crow nest)
Anton Lightning - Bosun
Oldman Strandiz (Maybe)
Jethro (There’s a reason why he’s an ex-GM) could Quartermaster
Provo (Somme’s friend inside a prison, used to be his ammunition expert, he could help decide weaponry of the ship, trebuchet)
Ceremonial daggers, both have gemstones on it, one has sapphire and one has emerald.
Nobility ceremony, commemorating a victory. Any kind of victory. Most likely not about a battle.
Hedwig finds another journal (Written in Stregan, date 890) Old journals, most pages are damaged by water) It was owned by Jacques Richelieum Cleric of Minerva. Goddess of civilization.
Something he is running from, something away or someone, took the ship heading to Senera.
Old ruined pack, that has a plate armor (period piece)
Markings, inside one of the gauntlets, it’s a symbol of a hand, a typical symbolism of the sun. One of the symbols of the church of the goddess of civilization, behind it is a cross of two hammers and a circle, seems to be a symbol of a renowned blacksmith, a devout follower of goddess of civilization from an early war epic. He’s only known as “Riche”. We could sell this for 5000 at the very least.
This sword is also made by Riche
Hedwig and Somme jumped off the window
Room of the first mate, ragged 9 tailed whip mounted on the wall. He is a Masochist. 
We find a strong box, Bronze, Contents: There are 8 bars of gold inside, filling up the strong box. Seneran royal seal, signs that it’s older than 300 years.
We could get a brand new boat and equipment.
Somme warns me about his friends. Who hates nobility.
Signet ring with a seal of seneran royalty (Prince) Somme said we can use it.
Hedwig goes to the mess hall to eat around 3 pm
Narmaya is a vampire
Helm has been abandoned
Visions of distance
Splinter group, called Reformist’s church
Anazai is no longer a kingdom but it's still a state
Collect as much loot as possible.
Narmaya might not be what cotto thinks she is
General Strandiz
Goal of the day, Find Anton Lightning

Somme’s journal, way before Hedwig joined, it seems like he doesn’t update his journal quite a lot. Pg. 27 is about capturing another supply ship. 
PG 28, Pick up Lady Hedwig Rosencrantz, Helda Stark. Only hope to find a magic user, fortunate that they found her, merely her chance, markets at port, one of the Myrrhian Islands. Port Pahia, looking to secure passage at a certain rate, yellow eyes. Offer her an easy job.

Reminds hedwig of bats
Hedwig finds a notebook that has been put under a piece of wood, an empty and just basically says an address
Says “for emergency purposes”
Theodore, he’s from Senera, he moved to Apgar, he is here to search for a man who calls himself Anton Lightnight, something prompted us that someone removed this ward from this place, a group of patriots who believe Senerans are trying to do something on this island. Preventive actions, making sure magic users will be recruited. Who’s your leader? Lead by Major Colonel Strandiz
He is residing in the military HQ in mayon.
Exact orders: find and secure every apgarian with yellow eyes and yellow hair and convince them that it is in their best interest to move to Apgar at Mayon.

Old men laughing
Degare Durant, a vice mayor of port Raenoso.
Justus Trafalgar - Myrrian person from Ahuria. 
Hedwig and Somme tries to sell the Riche Armor to Justus
It’s been said that Riche may have been consulting with a coven of Hags and the sort of Hags that has access to Ritma. Pagan rituals, they perform rituals for him.
He used to be a nobody blacksmith
He uses ghost blacksmith
Riche’s journal : In the backpage, there’s an embossed symbol of his marking.
1000 GP 1 bar, people who can afford it are noblemen and royals
Having a royal seal is valued very much because it guarantees their value as 1000 GP, people melt it to get a certain weight, they are guaranteeing it is pure 24k gold and the value is 1000 GP, it means that it is sure what you are getting.
The seal of the Dragonheart royal family, Narmaya knows that dragonhearts have a conservative economic policy, they don’t speculate with a lot of weird schemes, they are very solid in terms of value. They're Very well known as the sort of people to make sure that there's no cheating on it.
Salvaged from the ship from Ship’s graveyard.
The seal is changed in 1000 AI, 800s to 900s, we date this piece of gold bar pre 1000 AI. 
Narmaya check the ornate box
She tapped the side of the box and saw a locking mechanism, pressing gemstones. 
Narmaya hears a click, it exposes a pull up bar. Sort of latch
Inside: Seems to be something else, a piece of paper. Seneran.
“Payment of 8000 GP for the assassination of Estregan king” A stamp of a seal of the royal.
Narmaya appraised other Justus’s riche collection.
To obscure the fact that it’s fake, the spearhole was burst there that had been cleaned, making it seem that it was old and damaged. It used to conceal inconsistencies.
Second anazaian estregan war.
Riche
Famously used in key battles in anazaian estregan war
Journal said he is running 890
Estregan war 968
Narmaya was able to help Justus don the armor
Narmaya took a stroll with Le petit tigre
Hedwig feels like somebody's watching her.
Hedwig meets with the three girls.
Aside from feeling of creepiness, everything at this point sounds like nature
There are all sorts of creatures here but Irene and Sheila haven't seen anything weird, only mosquitoes.
End of the month, there’s going to be a party to celebrate the progress.
Political party, get themselves representation
Denise is thinking of taking office, a council
A platform for working girls
Denise is going to be fighting for government mandated paid maternity leave.
They wouldn’t think of it if it weren’t this group.
Hedwig feels something she never felt, the voices that had been nudging her to this place.
“Care and vigilance” 
Hedwig sees some rustling leaves about 80 ft away from me. There’s something peeking at us from a bush.
Hedwig sees it. It is shaped like a person, yet it looks green. Looks like a Moss.
Whatever this is has sort of webbed feet and webbed arms, underneath its neck is gills.
Godfrey - Merman
He has a wife and child back in the homestead
4th son of Jacoby
He is from jacoby’s homestead
Cracoix is working as a first mate
Sheila a masseus and a prostitute.
The Countess Carmilla - Woman who feeds on blood

Session

Hedwig
Hedwig continues travelling with the girls.
Hedwig spotted a mist and inside the mist were movements.
A person that's similar to Godfrey jumped off from the mist. A man modified to look more of a merfolk.
It attacked Hedwig.
Godfrey was overpowered
These modified people have red eyes.
One of them wields a spear.
The three of them are grappling Godfrey.
A blade made of coral.
Mer-looking creature starts dragging Godfrey away.
“Care and vigilance”
Crossbow bolt came from the direction where Sheila and Irene went.
Other women with gold yellow hair and eyes start moving in our general direction.
They began chanting, pushing this mist away.
A muscular woman about 5 ft 8, long straight down hair, yellow hair, pale skin. “Angela”
Amphibious folk they call them “Frogmen”
Two out of five women have yellow hair, all of them have yellow eyes.
Something turns them into this.
The mist starts to retreat.
There is a nexus point here in the bog that is still undiscovered.
These women introduced themselves as hags of hama.
After a few minutes, there is a wooden shack on stilts, recessed into the trees.
The doorway felt magical.
The other side of that threshold doesn’t seem magical.
As soon as Hedwig gets through the threshold, that feeling disappears.
The inside of the “mansion” can be described as a mansion. There’s a receiving area, a great hall, an open area with a chandelier in the middle and a grand staircase. Everything here is pretty much at home, gaudy looking noblemen’s home in Nura. Decorations aren’t Nuran. They seem reminiscent of patterns of figurines that had been brought by my Parents from an area closer to Burtz.
These Hags of hama are feminists.
Hedwig introduced herself as Helda Stark, an exiled noblewomen from Nura. An atheist. 
Denise Dubois - (Person of Interest) a woman who is planning to take an office. She is taking office in Raenoso. Denise is from Loretta Lane from an affluent family. She already has funding and the opportunity to run in the office. She’s one of those who have been promised. (Somme: She’s an up and coming in politics, giving women maternity leave and things of that sort)

Hags of Hama

Angela - She is probably a Sanerian. She’s speaking about the definition of Hags or coven. Angela doesn’t have any formal teachers, She learned to fight as a matter of life and death. She is doing a lot of things as a performance. She is a salesperson. Angela said that yellow hair and eyes are marks that we have access to rithma. She said that the others could unlock their powers. Hags of Hama are able to exchange their womanhood for power. They do not know where to exchange it yet, she’s saying that she’s here to explore the possibilities of women. Linked in by bounds of women. The church of the divine masochist has its roots from Arzadahd (A small Island from a coast : Manascula) She was the one who took possession of the divine masochist’s life. They are in the process of giving women self-esteem. 
Belinda - (Second in command) She is a daughter of a farmer in Chemise. (A state within Apgar, south of Parpelisse) looks like she wants to hurt Hedwig.
Carly - Aubergine (Border of Poasah) She said that she doesn’t have a tragic life like belinda. Her family was rescued by Angela.


Investigating the mansion

Bright light under the stairs
A fairly large kitchen, except that everything here is all white.
I do not see anything that resembles lanterns or light.
An actual light spell
Note : Tell the others about the frogmen and the strange things you saw in the bog.
We helped in the kitchens by carrying the plates to the dining hall.
Hedwig saw a glint of gold hair. Heard a door closed. A supply closet.
Hedwig investigated the supply closet.
Hedwig pretends to be naturally curious. Some people said it is her charm.
One of the shelving units inside the supply closet has a visible gap.
Belinda is looking inside the closet as if she is looking at something in particular.
Belinda’s eyes seem to linger to that gap.
Hedwig broke the lock and peek inside the gap, there's a corridor inside and a door that is open. Inside is a slope.
The food tasted a bit different.
Hedwig tastes something she doesn’t know but she knows she doesn’t want to eat.
Hedwig and Mary checked on Godfrey. Angela said he was left outside the wet area of the bog because they don’t allow Men inside the mansion.
Outside, there are 4 women who are acting like a guard.
She is untruthful
He only said to tell you that he is going to leave
Somme said they’re turning around for hours.
Godfrey left
These women are lying to us.
They’re planning to play boardgames.
It wouldn’t show the twists and turns, the map.
The bog is always changing.
How do the farmers get their escargot?
Is there a little village here?
Sheila and Irene seem to not be here.
They seem to be a bit distressed about the events earlier. They’re rooms on the second floor.
It’s better if they’re rested.

Repair materials - planks, special wood or iron pieces that need to be prepared. 
Crew needs - clothing, cooking utensils, artisans tools, the captain's gear... every piece of equipment, big or small. 
Food - the most perishable of supplies, food is always a problem. The first thing that sailors considered when getting food for a voyage was how long it lasts. Pickled vegetables and fruit, dried food (beans, biscuits, etc) were a constant. Salted meat also comes to mind. Oranges and lemons. Hedwig asked for a dessert bar and lots of wine.
Water - in theory, this can also be an issue as sea water isn't always potable and therefore there might be a need for the crew to have fresh water supplies as well.

Narmaya’s special shop - money can be exchanged with life force (my fave energy drink) and services. (Pls buy my garbage)
Herb of the Harem - what is the real purpose of this pill again? For conducting sex fests and orgies! I enjoy the benefits it gives me.
Pots and tobaccos - must be controlled and for sailors who are off-duty *wink wink*

The door towards the bog is currently open
Hedwig takes the front seat.
Hedwig sees some familiar faces among the crowd, women who works in raenoso
A pretty charismatic woman who knows how to present herself enters the room. 
She worked hard to convince the leadership of hags of hama to conduct today’s meeting with strong women.
Denise Dubois is a religious and pious woman
