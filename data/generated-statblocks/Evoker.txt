Sculpt Spells:
When the evoker casts a spell that forces creatures in an area to make a saving throw, they can choose up to 2 creatures within the area. These creatures automatically succeed on their saving throw and take no damage if they would normally take half damage.

Spellcasting:
The evoker is a 6th-level spellcaster. Their spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). They have the following spells prepared:

    Cantrips (at will): Fire Bolt, Mage Hand, Prestidigitation
    1st level (4 slots): Mage Armor, Magic Missile, Shield
    2nd level (3 slots): Scorching Ray, Misty Step
    3rd level (3 slots): Fireball, Counterspell

Actions

Fire Bolt (Cantrip):

    Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, range 120 ft., one target.
    Hit: 9 (2d10) fire damage.

Scorching Ray (2nd-level spell, 3 slots):

    The evoker creates three rays of fire and hurls them at targets within 120 ft. Each ray is a ranged spell attack: +5 to hit.
    Hit (per ray): 7 (2d6) fire damage.

Fireball (3rd-level spell, 2 slots):

    The evoker hurls a fiery explosion. Each creature in a 20-foot radius must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

Sculpt Spells Interaction: The evoker can shield allies within the Fireball's area, making them automatically succeed their saving throw and take no damage.
Reactions

Shield (1st-level spell, 2 slots):

    When hit by an attack or targeted by Magic Missile, the evoker raises their AC by 5 until the start of their next turn.

Counterspell (3rd-level spell, 1 slot):

    When another creature casts a spell within 60 feet, the evoker can attempt to interrupt the spell. If the spell is 3rd level or lower, it fails automatically. For higher-level spells, the evoker must succeed on an Intelligence check (DC = 10 + the spellâ€™s level).
