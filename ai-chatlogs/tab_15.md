[text]  
can you give me examples of how various languages from different families form reflexives. In particular, something that would fit an erg abs aligntment


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Let me share some interesting examples of reflexive formations across language families, 
focusing on ergative-absolutive languages.

**Dyirbal** (Pama-Nyungan, Australia)
```
bayi            yara         banggun   yara-nggu    bura-n
ABS.MASC.DET    man.ABS     ERG.DET   man-ERG      see-PAST
'The man saw himself'
```
Literally: "The man saw the man" - Dyirbal uses the same noun twice, with ergative 
marking on the agent.

**Georgian** (Kartvelian)
```
tav-s           v-i-xil-av
self-DAT        1SG.S-REFL-see-THM
'I see myself'
```
Uses a dedicated reflexive root _tav-_ ("head") plus verbal morphology.

**Basque** (Language Isolate)
```
neure    buru-a         ikusi   dut
my       head-ABS.DEF   see     AUX.1SG.ERG
'I saw myself'
```
Like Georgian, uses "head" (_buru_) as reflexive marker, but with possessive.

**Hinuq** (Northeast Caucasian)
```
už-ā        ži-w        w-ik-i-š
boy-ERG     REFL-ABS    M-see-PST-PST
'The boy saw himself'
```
Uses dedicated reflexive pronoun _ži-_ with absolutive case marking.

**Inuktitut** (Eskimo-Aleut)
```
taki-juq        immi-nik
see-3SG.INDIC   self-MOD
'He sees himself'
```
Uses reflexive pronoun _immi-_ with modalis case.

The key patterns we see in erg-abs languages for reflexives:

1. Body part terms ("head", "self") becoming grammaticalized
2. Dedicated reflexive pronouns taking absolutive marking
3. Sometimes using verbal morphology
4. Occasionally using full noun repetition

This differs from nominative-accusative languages which often just use special 
reflexive pronouns (like English "myself").

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these examples or provide more from other 
language families?
