So far, I've began to think that what makes Thera relevant to the interplanar sysrem is the fact that so many planes have connections to it. Some planes would 
also not have direct interactions with each other, if not for it.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
MD013/line-length: Line length [Expected: 80; Actual: 159]
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

I'll help you split that long line into multiple lines while maintaining readability.

```

The fix simply breaks the long line at natural points, keeping each line under 80 characters. I also noticed a typo: "sysrem" should probably be "system", but I left it as-is since you didn't ask about that.
