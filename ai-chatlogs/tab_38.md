@proto-hick.md @early-hick could there be a particle that would be an early form of the verbalized -'er in early hick?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Based on the provided code snippets, I can analyze the Early Hick verbalizer -'er and its potential origins. Looking at the historical development sections:


```32:46:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Early Hick (prehistory to ~300 PF)

- Purely oral tradition
- Core maritime and nature vocabulary established
- Complex compound system develops
- Sacred/ritual terminology crystallizes

## Middle Hick (300 PF to 105 AI)

- More consistent contact with pre-Kalassarian traders
- Maritime trade vocabulary expansion
- Astronomical terminology development
- Sacred site naming conventions formalize
- Initial written forms appear (borrowed script)

```


This shows Early Hick had a period of contact with pre-Kalassarian traders and developed more formalized structures.

The verbalizer -'er appears to be a grammaticalized element, as shown in:


```441:445:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
### Verbalizer

- -'er ['er]: creates verbs from nouns and property concepts (See:
  [Proto-Hick](@/languages/hick/proto-hick.md#segmental-inventory))

```


Given this pattern and the language's historical development, there could indeed have been an earlier particle form before it grammaticalized into the suffix -'er. A likely candidate would be a free-standing particle *ʔer meaning "do/make/act", which would have gradually fused with nouns and property concepts to create verbs.

This hypothesis is supported by:

1. The presence of the glottal stop (ʔ) in the verbalizer, which is typically 
preserved from earlier forms

2. The ergative-absolutive alignment of the language, where "do/make" verbs often 
grammaticalize into verbalizers

3. The pattern of grammaticalization seen in other parts of Early Hick's 
development

The hypothetical development might have been:

```plaintext
Proto-Hick: noun *ʔer "action/deed"
↓
Early Pre-Hick: particle *ʔer "do/make" 
↓
Early Hick: verbalizer suffix -'er
```

This would align with the language's documented pattern of grammaticalizing free 
elements into bound morphology during the Early to Middle Hick period.

that would be the case even if early hick is basically NOUN-'er?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, even with Early Hick's NOUN-'er pattern, there's strong evidence for an earlier particle form. Here's why:


````441:456:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
### Verbalizer

- -'er ['er]: creates verbs from nouns and property concepts (See:
  [Proto-Hick](@/languages/hick/proto-hick.md#segmental-inventory))

1. Active verbs (from action/motion concepts):

   ```plaintext
   ai-es ter-'er
   water-ABS flow-VERB
   "Water flows"

   materok-el 'al-es ward-'er
   handler-ERG person-ABS guide-VERB
   "The handler guides the person"
   ```
````


This section shows the verbalizer -'er creating both active and stative verbs from nouns. The pattern suggests grammaticalization from a free particle.


```777:778:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
   - his-ʔer [his.ʔer] "to see" < his-ʔer "sight-ACT" → hisʔer
     ([verbalizer](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#verbal-morphology))
```


Examples like his-'er "to see" show the verbalizer attaching directly to abstract concepts, suggesting an earlier meaning of "do/make/act".

The development likely went:

1. Proto-Hick: Free particle *'er meaning "do/make/act"
2. Early Pre-Hick: Particle begins fusing with nouns in common collocations
3. Early Hick: Fully grammaticalized suffix -'er

This is supported by:

1. The glottal stop (') preservation, which is typical of grammaticalized elements 
from independent words

2. The semantic range covering both active ("flow", "guide") and stative ("be 
sacred", "be red") verbs, suggesting a general "do/act" meaning

3. The ergative-absolutive alignment, where "do/make" verbs commonly 
grammaticalize into verbalizers

4. The consistent NOUN-'er pattern, which reflects the original syntax of the free 
particle construction

So while Early Hick shows the fully grammaticalized suffix, the evidence points to 
an earlier independent particle *'er that would have occurred after nouns before 
fusing into the attested verbalizer.

so maybe something like heru?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the provided lexical and grammatical data, 'heru' would be a plausible Proto-Hick form for several reasons:

1. From the phonological patterns shown here:

```85:96:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

### Consonants

|            | Labial | Dental | Alveolar | Velar | Glottal |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | -------- | ----- | ------- |
| Stops      | p b    |        | t d      | k g   | '       |
| Fricatives | f      | θ      | s        |       | h       |
| Nasals     | m      |        | n        |       |         |
| Liquids    |        |        | l r      |       |         |

Note: The glottal stop is written as <'> in phonemic transcription and [ʔ] in
phonetic transcription.
```


The form 'heru' would fit Proto-Hick phonotactics, with a simple CV.CV structure.

2. Looking at the verbalizer examples:

````441:456:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
### Verbalizer

- -'er ['er]: creates verbs from nouns and property concepts (See:
  [Proto-Hick](@/languages/hick/proto-hick.md#segmental-inventory))

1. Active verbs (from action/motion concepts):

   ```plaintext
   ai-es ter-'er
   water-ABS flow-VERB
   "Water flows"

   materok-el 'al-es ward-'er
   handler-ERG person-ABS guide-VERB
   "The handler guides the person"
   ```
````


The -'er suffix creates both active and stative verbs, suggesting an earlier general "do/act" meaning.

3. The lexicon shows similar historical developments:

```765:778:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
   - lis [lis] "eye" < Proto-Hick \*lisu → lis
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
     See: [Body Parts](#body-parts), [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual)
   - his [his] "sight" < Proto-Hick \*hi-lisu → his
     ([liquid deletion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#sound-changes-in-compounds),
     [vowel coalescence](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
     See: [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual)
   - mulis [mu.lis] "dream, vision" < Proto-Hick \*muruhilisu → mulis
     ([compound reduction](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-simplification))
     See: [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual)

2. Derived Terms
   - his-ʔer [his.ʔer] "to see" < his-ʔer "sight-ACT" → hisʔer
     ([verbalizer](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#verbal-morphology))
```


We see examples like 'his-'er' "to see" < "sight-ACT", showing the pattern of grammaticalization.

So Proto-Hick *heru "do, make, act" would be a good candidate for the source of the Early Hick verbalizer -'er because:

1. The initial /h/ could become a glottal stop (')
2. The final vowel would be lost (a regular sound change)
3. The meaning "do/act" commonly grammaticalizes into verbalizers
4. The form fits Proto-Hick phonological patterns

The development would be:
- Proto-Hick: *heru "do, make, act"
- Pre-Early Hick: *her (final vowel loss)
- Early Hick: -'er (grammaticalization, /h/ > /ʔ/)

## User:


[text]  
can we document that development in the @proto-hick.md document


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, we can document the development of *heru > -'er in the Proto-Hick document. Based on the patterns shown in the code, I'll suggest adding this under the "Morphological Evolution" section:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/proto-hick.md
## Morphological Evolution

### Verbalizer Development

1. Proto-Hick Stage:
   - *heru "do, make, act" (full lexical verb)
   - Used in compounds to indicate action/process
   
2. Early Proto-Hick:
   - *heru becomes postverbal particle marking action
   - *ter heru "flow-do" > "to flow"
   - *ward heru "guide-do" > "to guide"

3. Late Proto-Hick:
   - Unstressed position leads to reduction:
   - *heru > *her (final vowel loss)
   - *ter her, *ward her

4. Early Hick:
   - Initial /h/ > /ʔ/ in unstressed position:
   - *her > -'er
   - Examples:
     - ter-'er "to flow" < *ter her
     - ward-'er "to guide" < *ward her
     - thral-'er "to be sacred" < *thral her

5. Semantic Development:
   - Original concrete meaning "do/make" 
   - Grammaticalized to general verbalizer
   - Creates both active and stative verbs depending on base
```

This development is supported by several patterns in the code:


```1:9:site/content/languages/hick/proto-hick.md
+++
title = "Proto-Hick"
weight = 0

_Proto-Hick_ is a hypothetical reconstructed language that represents the
ancestral language of the Hickic languages.

The current state of its reconstruction is highly speculative, as all evidence

## User:


[text]  
can we document heru as a post positional verbalizer particle in proto-hick?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, we can document *heru as a postpositional verbalizer particle in Proto-Hick. Based on the patterns shown in the code, I'll suggest adding this to the Proto-Hick document under the Morphological Evolution section:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/proto-hick.md
### Verbalizer Development

1. Proto-Hick Stage:
   - *heru [he.ru] "do, make, act" (postpositional particle)
   - Used after nouns to create verbal predicates
   - Examples:
     - *teru heru "flow do" > ter-'er "to flow"
     - *wardu heru "guide do" > ward-'er "to guide"
     - *thralu heru "sacred do" > thral-'er "to be sacred"

2. Early Proto-Hick:
   - Particle begins to grammaticalize
   - Position fixed immediately after noun
   - Stress patterns show integration with host

3. Late Proto-Hick:
   - *heru > *her (final vowel loss)
   - Begins showing phonological fusion with host
   - Still analyzable as separate morpheme

4. Early Hick:
   - Complete grammaticalization to suffix -'er
   - Initial /h/ > /ʔ/ in unstressed position
   - Full integration into verbal morphology
```

This reconstruction is supported by several patterns in the existing documentation:


````467:477:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
