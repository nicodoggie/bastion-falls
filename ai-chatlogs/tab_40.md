[text]  
I don't believe we have a section for clause construction yet. how do you believe we should proceed in fleshing that out?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Based on the available documentation, I notice several patterns that could help us construct a clause structure section. Here's how I suggest we proceed:

1. From the examples scattered throughout (especially in the lexicon), we can see Early Hick uses:
- Ergative-absolutive alignment
- SOV word order (e.g. `materok-el ʔal-es ward-ter` "handler-ERG person-ABS direct-to")
- Case marking via suffixes
- Directional markers that can replace verbal elements

2. I suggest adding a new section in `early-hick/_index.md` after the Morphology section:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
# Syntax

## Basic Clause Structure

1. Core Arguments
   - SOV basic word order
   - Ergative (-el) marks transitive subject
   - Absolutive (-es) marks transitive object and intransitive subject
   - Examples:
     ```plaintext
     materok-el rismater-es ward-ter
     handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS direct-to
     "The handler directs the reed boat"

     ʔal-es ter-ʔer
     person-ABS move-ACT
     "The person moves"
     ```

2. Directional Clauses
   - Direction markers can replace verbal elements
   - Goal takes directional case (-aes, -imris, etc.)
   - Agent remains in ergative
   - Examples:
     ```plaintext
     materok-el rismater-aes
     handler-ERG reed.boat-ILL
     "The handler (goes) into the reed boat"

     materok-el keth-imris
     handler-ERG sea-ELL
     "The handler (comes) from the sea"
     ```

3. Compound Verbs
   - Formed with -ʔer verbalizer
   - Maintain SOV order
   - Examples:
     ```plaintext
     ʔal-es his-ʔer
     person-ABS sight-ACT
     "The person sees"

     thral-el kel-es kakel-ʔer
     ritual-ERG sky-ABS blue-ACT
     "The ritual makes the sky blue"
     ```
```

3. We should also document:
- Subordinate clauses
- Question formation
- Topic/focus positions
- Temporal framing (which we see hints of with sentence-initial position)
- Serial verb constructions (if they exist)

Would you like me to continue with any of these additional aspects, or should we refine the basic clause structure first?

## User:


[text]  
I don't think we would have a strict word order, but maybe we can work that in with voice/tense/aspect?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Ah, that's a good point! Looking at the examples and cultural context, a more fluid word order system that interacts with voice/TAM marking makes sense. Let me revise the proposal:

````markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
# Syntax

## Clause Structure and Word Order

1. Basic Patterns
   - Core arguments marked by case, allowing flexible word order
   - Ergative (-el) marks agent of transitive verbs
   - Absolutive (-es) marks patient of transitive & sole argument of intransitive
   - Word order signals pragmatic functions rather than grammatical roles

2. Information Structure
   - Initial position: topic/focus or temporal frame
   - Final position: new information or emphasis
   - Examples:
     ```plaintext
     branum bramisimris kethes
     past    river-ELL    sea-ABS
     "In the past, the river flowed to the sea" (temporal frame first)

     kethes bramisimris branum
     sea-ABS river-ELL    past
     "The river flowed to the sea, in the past" (neutral statement)

     bramisimris branum kethes
     river-ELL    past    sea-ABS
     "It was to the sea that the river flowed" (destination focus)
     ```

3. Voice and Aspect Effects
   - Active voice (-ʔer) tends toward agent-initial order:
     ```plaintext
     materok-el rismater-es ward-ʔer
     handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide-ACT
     "The handler guides the reed boat"
     ```
   - Stative constructions favor patient-initial:
     ```plaintext
     rismater-es tel ward
     reed.boat-ABS COMPL guide
     "The reed boat was guided"
     ```
   - Directional constructions allow goal prominence:
     ```plaintext
     keth-aes materok-el rismater-es
     sea-ILL  handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS
     "To sea the handler (takes) the reed boat"
     ```

4. Temporal Reference
   - Time words can float freely but tend toward:
     - Initial: setting temporal frame for discourse
     - Pre-verbal: marking temporal contrast
     - Final: neutral narrative position
   - Examples:
     ```plaintext
     branum materok-el ward-ʔer  # Frame-setting
     past    handler-ERG guide-ACT
     "In the past, the handler guided"

     materok-el branum ward-ʔer  # Temporal contrast
     handler-ERG past    guide-ACT
     "The handler USED TO guide"

     materok-el ward-ʔer branum  # Neutral narrative
     handler-ERG guide-ACT past
     "The handler guided, in the past"
     ```
````

This better reflects the pragmatic flexibility while maintaining the core case system. Should we expand on how aspect markers and different verb forms affect positioning, or would you like to adjust this approach further?

## User:


[text]  
I'm not sure what the agentive marker would have to do with the active voice?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Ah, you're absolutely right - I made an incorrect connection there. Looking at the documentation:

- -ok is clearly marked as an agentive nominalizer that forms agent nouns (like materok "boatman" < mater-ok "vessel-AGENT")
- -ʔer is marked as a verbalizer that creates active verbs (like ter-ʔer "to flow")

Let me revise that section to remove the confusion between agentive nominalization and voice:

````markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Clause Structure and Word Order

1. Basic Patterns
   - Core arguments marked by case, allowing flexible word order
   - Ergative (-el) marks agent of transitive verbs
   - Absolutive (-es) marks patient of transitive & sole argument of intransitive
   - Word order signals pragmatic functions rather than grammatical roles

2. Information Structure
   - Initial position: topic/focus or temporal frame
   - Final position: new information or emphasis
   - Examples:
     ```plaintext
     branum bramisimris kethes
     past    river-ELL    sea-ABS
     "In the past, the river flowed to the sea" (temporal frame first)

     kethes bramisimris branum
     sea-ABS river-ELL    past
     "The river flowed to the sea, in the past" (neutral statement)
     ```

3. Verb Position and Aspect
   - Verbs can occur in different positions based on aspect:
     ```plaintext
     materok-el rismater-es ward tel
     handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide COMPL
     "The handler has guided the reed boat" (completed action)

     rismater-es ward kethes
     reed.boat-ABS guide sea-ABS
     "The reed boat guides to sea" (general statement)
     ```
   - Directional constructions allow goal prominence:
     ```plaintext
     keth-aes materok-el rismater-es
     sea-ILL  handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS
     "To sea the handler (takes) the reed boat"
     ```
````

Would you like me to continue revising the other sections to better reflect the distinction between nominalization (-ok) and verbal formation (-ʔer)?

## User:


[text]  
yes please


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



I'll revise to better separate these concepts and show how they interact in clauses:

````markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Core Grammar

### Agentive Marking

1. Primary Marker
   - -ok [ok]: agentive nominalizer (forms agent nouns, both occupational and 
     active)
   Examples:
   - materok "boatman" < mater-ok "vessel-AGENT" (one who works with vessels)
   - wardok "guide" < ward-ok "direct-AGENT" (one who directs)
   - threnok "watcher" < thren-ok "watch-AGENT" (one who watches)

[Note: The -er suffix appears in Middle Hick through Old Iutlandish contact, 
leading to the occupational/active distinction between -ok/-er in Late Hick]

### Verbal System

1. Verbalizer
   - -ʔer [ʔer]: creates active verbs
   Examples:
   - ter-ʔer "to flow" (flow-ACT)
   - thral-ʔer "to be sacred" (sacred-ACT)
   - thren-ʔer "to watch" (watch-ACT)

2. Example Clauses:
   ```plaintext
   materok-el rismater-es ward
   boatman-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide
   "The boatman guides the reed boat"

   threnok-el keth-es thren-ʔer
   watcher-ERG sea-ABS watch-ACT
   "The watchman watches the sea"
   ```

### Clause Structure

1. Core Arguments
   - Ergative (-el) marks agent of transitive verbs
   - Absolutive (-es) marks patient of transitive & sole argument of intransitive
   - Agent nouns in -ok can take case marking like other nouns
   Examples:
   ```plaintext
   wardok-el ʔal-es ward
   guide-ERG person-ABS direct
   "The guide directs the person"

   threnok-es ter-ʔer
   watcher-ABS move-ACT
   "The watcher moves"
   ```

2. Verb Position
   - Verbs (both basic and -ʔer forms) can occur in different positions:
   ```plaintext
   materok-el ward rismater-es
   boatman-ERG guide reed.boat-ABS
   "The boatman guides the reed boat" (neutral)

   ward materok-el rismater-es
   guide boatman-ERG reed.boat-ABS
   "The boatman GUIDES the reed boat" (verb focus)
   ```
````

This revision:
1. Clearly separates -ok as a nominalizer from -ʔer as a verbalizer
2. Shows how agent nouns take normal case marking
3. Demonstrates how both basic verbs and -ʔer verbs function in clauses

Should I continue with more examples or would you like to adjust this approach?

## User:


[text]  
you mark the ?er verbalizer as making active verbs, but you seem to be ignoring the fact that the verbalizer also marks statives. 


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Ah, you're absolutely right! Looking at examples like `thral-ʔer` "to be sacred", these are clearly stative verbs, not active ones. Let me revise to better reflect this:

````markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
### Verbal System

1. Verbalizer
   - -ʔer [ʔer]: creates verbs from nouns/adjectives
   Examples:
   - ter-ʔer "to flow" (flow-VERB) (active)
   - thral-ʔer "to be sacred" (sacred-VERB) (stative)
   - thren-ʔer "to watch" (watch-VERB) (active)
   - kel-ʔer "to be blue/sky-colored" (sky-VERB) (stative)

2. Example Clauses:
   ```plaintext
   # Active verbs
   materok-el rismater-es ward-ʔer
   boatman-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide-VERB
   "The boatman guides the reed boat"

   # Stative verbs
   tor-es thral-ʔer
   peak-ABS sacred-VERB
   "The peak is sacred"

   kel-es mar-ʔer
   sky-ABS red-VERB
   "The sky is red"
   ```

3. Semantic Classes of -ʔer Verbs
   - Active verbs: physical actions (ter-ʔer "flow", ward-ʔer "guide")
   - Stative verbs: 
     - States (thral-ʔer "be sacred")
     - Properties (kel-ʔer "be blue")
     - Positions (tel-ʔer "be placed/situated")
````

Would you like me to expand on how these different verb types might interact with aspect marking or word order?

## User:


[text]  
see also the section on adjectivals


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



I don't see a section on adjectivals in the current documentation. This seems like an important gap we should fill, especially given the interaction with the -ʔer verbalizer and stative verbs. Would you like me to propose a section on adjectivals that would help clarify these relationships?

Based on the examples we have (like thral "sacred", kel "sky/blue", mar "red"), it seems Early Hick might treat property concepts in an interesting way, potentially as a noun-like class that can:
1. Function attributively
2. Become stative verbs with -ʔer
3. Possibly take case marking themselves

Would you like me to draft a section on adjectivals to explore these patterns?

## Adjectival Morphology


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Ah, I see - let me propose a section on adjectival morphology that ties together what we're seeing with property concepts and the -ʔer verbalizer:

````markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Adjectival Morphology

1. Basic Properties
   - Property concepts are noun-like in Early Hick
   - Can function attributively or predicatively
   - Take case marking when functioning as core arguments
   Examples:
   ```plaintext
   thral tor    # Attributive
   sacred peak
   "sacred peak"

   tor-es thral # Predicative nominal
   peak-ABS sacred
   "the peak (is) sacred"
   ```

2. Verbalizer -ʔer
   - Creates stative verbs from property concepts
   - Maintains case alignment of non-verbal predicates
   Examples:
   ```plaintext
   tor-es thral-ʔer
   peak-ABS sacred-VERB
   "the peak is sacred"

   kel-es mar-ʔer
   sky-ABS red-VERB
   "the sky is red"
   ```

3. Compound Formation
   - Property concepts can be first or second elements
   - First position modifies second element:
     ```plaintext
     mar-wud → marwud
     red-wood → "redwood"
     
     thral-kel → thrakel
     sacred-sky → "sun"
     ```
   - Second position creates new property concept:
     ```plaintext
     kel-mar → kelmar
     sky-red → "sky-red (specific shade)"
     ```

4. Case Relations
   - Take absolutive when functioning as predicates:
     ```plaintext
     tor-es thral-es
     peak-ABS sacred-ABS
     "the peak (is) sacred"
     ```
   - Can take ergative in causative constructions:
     ```plaintext
     thral-el kel-es mar-ʔer
     sacred-ERG sky-ABS red-VERB
     "the sacred (thing) makes the sky red"
     ```
````

This ties together:
1. The nominal nature of property concepts
2. Their interaction with -ʔer
3. Their role in compounds
4. Their case-marking behavior

Would you like me to expand any particular aspect of this, or should we adjust the approach?

## User:


[text]  
I mean to say we have that existing section already, so we may want to see if what you propose with the verbalizers and their use in syntax is consistent with what we're already doing


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Ah, I apologize - you're right that we should check the existing adjectival section first to ensure consistency. However, I don't see it in the provided code snippets. Could you share the existing adjectival morphology section so I can review it and ensure my proposed verbal system description aligns with what's already established?

This would help us:
1. Verify the behavior of property concepts
2. Confirm how -ʔer interacts with different word classes
3. Ensure our syntax description matches established patterns
4. Identify any gaps or inconsistencies

Would you be able to share that section?

## User:


[text]  
@early-hick should have them


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

I don't see the adjectival morphology section in the provided code snippets from early-hick/_index.md (lines 1-903). The relevant sections I can see are:

1. Verbalizer section:

```794:801:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Verbal Morphology

### Verbalizer
   - materokel rismaterimris "the boatman exits the reed boat"
- -ʔer [ʔer]: creates active verbs Examples:
- ter-ʔer "to flow" (flow-ACT)
- thral-ʔer "to be sacred" (sacred-ACT)
- thren-ʔer "to watch" (watch-ACT)
```


2. Derivational morphology section (which includes some relevant affixes):

```825:861:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Derivational Morphology
- Basic Pattern: modifier-head
### Similarity Prefix
  - Liquid deletion: tor-mal → tomal
- ka- [kə]: prefix meaning "like, similar to"
- Always surfaces as [kə-] due to regular vowel reduction Examples:
- ka-tor [kə.tor] "hill-like" (smaller than a mountain)
- ka-mal [kə.mal] "pond-like" (smaller than a lake)
- ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)
### Body Metaphors
### Negation System
1. Breath as the soul
- mo- [mo]: general negation prefix Examples:
- mo-thral "non-sacred, profane"
- mo-ter "not flowing, stagnant"
- mo-ward "misdirect, lead astray"
6. Eyes as reality
### Compound Formation

- Basic Pattern: modifier-head
- Sound changes:
  - Liquid deletion: tor-mal → tomal
  - Nasal deletion: bram-mal → bramal Examples:
- kur-tin → kurtin "bronze" (copper-tin)
- bram-mater → brammater "river vessel" (tide-vessel)
- thral-kel → thrakel "sun" (sacred-sky)
   - Maximum of three prefixes and two suffixes
### Body Metaphors
2. Order of Elements
1. Breath as the soul
2. Liver as source of life
3. Heart as source of emotion
4. Bones as structure
5. Hands as tools
6. Eyes as reality
7. Skin as appearance

```


Could you point me to where the adjectival morphology section is located? It might be in a part of the file that wasn't included in the snippets, or in another file. This would help ensure any proposals about verbalizers and syntax align with the existing adjectival system.

## User:


[text]  
currently starts at line 567


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

I see - let me check the provided code for the adjectival morphology section. Looking at the line numbers:


```567:588:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Adjectival Morphology

Early Hick has no true adjective class. Quality concepts are expressed through:
      ritual.ERG blue.TRANS  
1. Stative Verbs
      "ritual makes sky blue"  
   - Uses verbalizer -ʔer
   - Takes absolutive argument Examples:
   - kel-es kakel'er "sky-ABS blue.VERB" (the sky is blue)
   - thral-el kel-es kakel'er "ritual-ERG sky-ABS blue.VERB" (the ritual makes
     the sky blue)
      "red sky turns blue"  
2. Change of State

   1. Translative (-sim):  
      keles kakelsim  
      sky.ABS blue.TRANS  
      "sky becomes blue"  
      (general change of state)
3. Notes:
      thralel kakelsim keles  
      ritual.ERG blue.TRANS  
```


Now I can see how my earlier proposal about verbalizers and stative verbs needs to align with the existing adjectival system. Would you like me to propose revisions to the verbal system section (lines 331-349) to better reflect this relationship?

## User:


[text]  
yes please


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the code, I notice several inconsistencies that need to be addressed. Let me propose revisions to align the verbal system with the adjectival morphology:

1. The verbalizer -ʔer is described inconsistently:

```331:338:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
### Verbal System

1. Verbalizer
   - -ʔer [ʔer]: creates active verbs
   Examples:
   - ter-ʔer "to flow" (flow-ACT)
   - thral-ʔer "to be sacred" (sacred-ACT)
   - thren-ʔer "to watch" (watch-ACT)
```

and again at:

```796:801:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
### Verbalizer
   - materokel rismaterimris "the boatman exits the reed boat"
- -ʔer [ʔer]: creates active verbs Examples:
- ter-ʔer "to flow" (flow-ACT)
- thral-ʔer "to be sacred" (sacred-ACT)
- thren-ʔer "to watch" (watch-ACT)
```


Both sections describe it as creating "active verbs", but we see examples of stative usage in the lexicon:

```661:669:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
1. ai-es ter-ʔer  
   water-ABS flow-ACT  
   "Water flows"
2. mal-thir-el ai-es ward-ter  
   pool-KNOWN.ANIM-ERG water-ABS contain-to  
   "The known pool contains water"
3. tor-thir-es thral-ʔer  
   peak-KNOWN.ANIM-ABS sacred-ACT  
   "The known peak is sacred"
```


Here's my proposed revision for the Verbal System section:

```markdown
### Verbal System

1. Verbalizer
   - -ʔer [ʔer]: creates verbs from nouns and property concepts
   Examples:
   a. Active verbs:
   - ter-ʔer "to flow" (flow-VERB)
   - thren-ʔer "to watch" (watch-VERB)
   
   b. Stative verbs:
   - thral-ʔer "to be sacred" (sacred-VERB)
   - kakel-ʔer "to be blue" (blue-VERB)

2. Example Clauses:
   ```plaintext
   # Active
   threnok-el keth-es thren-ʔer
   watcher-ERG sea-ABS watch-VERB
   "The watchman watches the sea"

   # Stative
   tor-es thral-ʔer
   peak-ABS sacred-VERB
   "The peak is sacred"
   ```
```

Would you like me to continue with revisions to other related sections to maintain consistency?

## User:


[text]  
yes please. this last one seems to be more consistent with what I had in mind as well


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Looking at the lexicon examples (especially lines 661-669), we can see that -ʔer creates both active and stative verbs. Let me propose a revision to the Verbal Morphology section that better reflects this pattern:

````markdown
## Verbal Morphology

### Verbalizer

- -ʔer [ʔer]: creates verbs from nouns and property concepts
  1. Active verbs:
     ```plaintext
     ai-es ter-ʔer
     water-ABS flow-VERB
     "Water flows"
     
     murmer-is-el sak-es thren-ʔer
     owl-PROX.ANIM-ERG wolf-ABS watch-VERB
     "This owl watches the wolf"
     ```
  
  2. Stative verbs:
     ```plaintext
     tor-thir-es thral-ʔer
     peak-KNOWN.ANIM-ABS sacred-VERB
     "The known peak is sacred"
     ```

Note: The same verbalizer creates both active and stative verbs, with the 
interpretation depending on the semantics of the base word:
- Action/motion concepts → active verbs (ter-ʔer "flow", thren-ʔer "watch")
- Property concepts → stative verbs (thral-ʔer "be sacred")
````

This better aligns with:
1. The lexicon examples (lines 661-675)
2. The property concept system shown in the examples
3. The overall ergative-absolutive alignment (lines 284-287)

Would you like me to continue with revisions to related sections?

## User:


[text]  
yes please


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Looking at the code, I notice we have duplicate sections of Verbal Morphology (lines 331-371 and lines 835-861) that need to be consolidated. The second version is more accurate but could be improved. I also see we need to better integrate with the lexicon examples (lines 661-675).

Here's my proposed revision:

````markdown
## Verbal Morphology

### Verbalizer

- -ʔer [ʔer]: creates verbs from nouns and property concepts
  1. Active verbs (from action/motion concepts):
     ```plaintext
     ai-es ter-ʔer
     water-ABS flow-VERB
     "Water flows"
     
     murmer-is-el sak-es thren-ʔer
     owl-PROX.ANIM-ERG wolf-ABS watch-VERB
     "This owl watches the wolf"
     ```
  
  2. Stative verbs (from property concepts):
     ```plaintext
     tor-thir-es thral-ʔer
     peak-KNOWN.ANIM-ABS sacred-VERB
     "The known peak is sacred"

     kel-es mar-ʔer
     sky-ABS red-VERB
     "The sky is red"
     ```

Note: The interpretation as active or stative depends on the base word:
- Action roots (ter "flow", thren "watch") → active verbs
- Property roots (thral "sacred", mar "red") → stative verbs
- Some roots can function both ways depending on context

### Interaction with Case System

1. Active Verbs:
   - Take ergative agent and absolutive patient
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     materok-el kethmater-im-ris keth-es ward-ter
     boatman-ERG sea.vessel-PROX-ELL sea-ABS direct-to
     "The boatman takes the sea vessel to the ocean"
     ```

2. Stative Verbs:
   - Take absolutive argument only
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     mal-thir-es thral-ʔer
     pool-KNOWN.ANIM-ABS sacred-VERB
     "The known pool is sacred"
     ```
````

This revision:
1. Removes the duplicate sections
2. Better integrates with the lexicon examples
3. Shows the case marking patterns clearly
4. Maintains consistency with the property concept system

Would you like me to continue with related sections that need adjustment?

## User:


[text]  
why did you remove the section about adjectival morphology though? I don't think that's redundant at all


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



You're absolutely right - I apologize for suggesting removing the adjectival morphology section. Looking at the code, I can see that the adjectival morphology section (lines 567-588) and the verbal morphology sections (lines 331-371, 558-608, and 816-866) actually complement each other rather than being redundant.

The adjectival section establishes that Early Hick has no true adjective class and explains how quality concepts are expressed, while the verbal sections detail how the -ʔer verbalizer works with different types of roots.

Would you like me to:
1. Keep both sections
2. Ensure they cross-reference each other appropriately
3. Make sure the terminology and examples are consistent between them

That way we maintain the important distinction between property concepts and verbs while showing how they interact through the -ʔer verbalizer?

1 2 and 3 please


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the code, I see we need to:

1. Keep both the adjectival morphology section (lines 609-651) and verbal morphology sections (lines 331-371, 558-608, and 836-884)

2. Ensure they cross-reference each other with a note in each section

3. Make terminology consistent

Here's my proposed revision:

````markdown
## Adjectival Morphology

Early Hick has no true adjective class. Quality concepts are expressed through:

1. Stative Verbs (See: [Verbal Morphology](#verbal-morphology))
   - Uses verbalizer -ʔer
   - Takes absolutive argument
   Examples:
   ```plaintext
   kel-es kakel-ʔer
   sky-ABS blue-VERB
   "The sky is blue"
   
   thral-el kel-es kakel-ʔer
   ritual-ERG sky-ABS blue-VERB
   "The ritual makes the sky blue"
   ```

2. Change of State
   1. Translative (-sim):
      ```plaintext
      kel-es kakel-sim
      sky.ABS blue.TRANS
      "sky becomes blue"
      ```
      
   2. Directional Cases (-aes/-imris):
      ```plaintext
      kamar kel-es kakel-aes
      red sky-ABS blue-ILL
      "red sky turns blue"
      ```

3. Notes:
   - No attributive modification
   - All qualities are verbal predicates
   - Follows ergative-absolutive alignment
   - Causatives marked by adding ergative agent
````

And for the verbal section:

````markdown
## Verbal Morphology

### Verbalizer

- -ʔer [ʔer]: creates verbs from nouns and property concepts 
  (See: [Adjectival Morphology](#adjectival-morphology))

1. Active verbs (from action/motion concepts):
   ```plaintext
   ai-es ter-ʔer
   water-ABS flow-VERB
   "Water flows"
   ```

2. Stative verbs (from property concepts):
   ```plaintext
   tor-es thral-ʔer
   peak-ABS sacred-VERB
   "The peak is sacred"
   ```

Note: The interpretation depends on the base word:
- Action roots → active verbs (ter "flow", thren "watch") 
- Property roots → stative verbs (thral "sacred", kakel "blue")

Would you like me to continue with other sections that need adjustment?

## User:


[text]  
what other sections do you believe need adjustment?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the code, I see several sections that need adjustment to maintain consistency:

1. Verbal System section appears three times with slightly different content:

```331:374:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
contact, leading to the occupational/active distinction between -ok/-er in Late Hick]

### Tense and Aspect Marking
   - -ʔer [ʔer]: creates active verbs
1. Basic Temporal Markers
   - ter-ʔer "to flow" (flow-ACT)
   - branum [bra.num] "past" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.INAN")
     - From bran "dawn" + -um "distal inanimate"
     - Conceptualizes past as distant dawn-time, reflecting Hick cultural view
       of time flowing from dawn to night
     - Used for general past reference and historical narratives
   - branrum [bran.rum] "ancestral time" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.ANIM")
     - Uses animate distal marker -rum to personify ancestral time
     - Specifically used for sacred histories and ancestral stories
     - Contrasts with branum by marking time as animate/sacred
   - mulsum [mul.sum] "future" (lit. "night-change-DIST")
     - From mulsimrum "changes to a distant night"
     - Grammaticalized through reduction: mulsimrum → mulsum
     - Reflects Hick metaphor of future as approaching darkness
     - Used for both predictions and intentions
### Tense and Aspect Marking
2. Completive Marking
1. Basic Temporal Markers
   - tel [tel] "complete, finished"
     - Follows clause for past perfect meaning
     - Derives from Proto-Hick \*telu "place/position"
     - Metaphorical extension: reaching a place → completion
     - Example: bramisimris kethes branum tel "the river had flowed to the sea"
     - Used for general past reference and historical narratives
3. Position and Usage
     - Uses animate distal marker -rum to personify ancestral time
   - Sentence-initial (topic/focus):
     - Marks temporal frame for entire discourse
     - Often used in formal/ritual speech
     - Example: branum bramisimris kethes "In the past, the river flowed to the
       sea"
   - Sentence-final (neutral):
     - Default narrative position
     - Most common in everyday speech
     - Example: bramisimris kethes branum "The river flowed to the sea"
   - Pre-verbal (emphasis):
     - Marks temporal contrast
     - Used for emphasis or correction
     - Example: bramisimris branum kethes "The river USED TO flow to sea"
```


```447:453:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - Examples:
     - tornes [tor.nes] "great fish, whale"
     - topel [to.pel] "great bear" (tor-pel → topel, liquid deletion)
     - tomal [to.mal] "great pool, lake" (tor-mal → tomal, liquid deletion)
3. Speed Augmentative (tor- -sim)
   - Circumfix combining the argumentative tor- with the translative -sim to
     mean a swift change in speed
```

   - Agent suffix must precede case suffix
1. Inner Suffixes (closer to root)
2. Phonological Interactions
   - Prefix ka- always reduces to [kə-]

3. The Affix Order section needs to include -ʔer in its template:

```720:755:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - Interacts with case marking: ma-tor-el (PL-height-ERG)
2. Augmentative (tor-)
### Similarity Marking
   - Examples:
1. Similarity Prefix (ka-)
   - Prefix meaning "like, similar to"
   - Always surfaces as [kə-] due to regular vowel reduction
   - Examples:
     - ka-tor [kə.tor] "hill-like" (smaller than a mountain)
     - ka-mal [kə.mal] "pond-like" (smaller than a lake)
     - ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)
2. Usage Domains
   - Natural Features: kətor "hill-like", kəmal "pond-like"
   - Animals: kəpel "bear-like", kəmer "bird-like"
   - Body Parts: kəbel "mouth-like", kəven "wing-like"
   - Weather: kəbran "storm-like", kəthral "mist-like"
   - Water Movement: kəran "stream-like", kəthrim "wave-like"
   - Plant Growth: kəthir "grass-like", kəbel "vine-like"
   - Sounds: kəmer "bird-like (sound)", kəsak "wolf-like (howl)"
### Number Marking

   - -is [is] "this" (inanimate)
   - -ʔis [ʔis] "this" (animate)
   - -en [en] "that" (inanimate)
   - -tan [tan] "that" (animate)
2. Hidden but Sensed
   - -eth [eθ] "this/that" (inanimate)
   - -thir [θir] "this/that" (animate)
3. Distant/Out of Sight
   - -um [um] "that" (inanimate)
   - -rum [rum] "that" (animate)
   - Weather: kəbran "storm-like", kəthral "mist-like"
### Personal Reference
   - Plant Growth: kəthir "grass-like", kəbel "vine-like"
```


4. The Suffix Classes section needs to clarify the relationship between -ʔer and -er:

```756:768:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
1. Spatial Demonstratives
   - istel-ʔal "this.place-person" (speaker's location)
   - ethtel-ʔal "that.place-person" (addressee's location)
   - umtel-ʔal "far.place-person" (third party location)
1. Visible/Known
### Negation System
   - -ʔis [ʔis] "this" (animate)
1. Basic Negation
   - mo- [mo]: general negation prefix Examples:
     - mo-thral "non-sacred, profane"
     - mo-ter "not flowing, stagnant"
     - mo-ward "misdirect, lead astray"
3. Distant/Out of Sight
```

## Verbal Morphology

### Verbalizer

- -ʔer [ʔer]: creates verbs from nouns and property concepts 
  (See: [Adjectival Morphology](#adjectival-morphology))

1. Active verbs (from action/motion concepts):
   ```plaintext
   ai-es ter-ʔer
   water-ABS flow-VERB
   "Water flows"
   
   murmer-is-el sak-es thren-ʔer
   owl-PROX.ANIM-ERG wolf-ABS watch-VERB
   "This owl watches the wolf"
   ```

2. Stative verbs (from property concepts):
   ```plaintext
   tor-thir-es thral-ʔer
   peak-KNOWN.ANIM-ABS sacred-VERB
   "The known peak is sacred"
   
   kel-es mar-ʔer
   sky-ABS red-VERB
   "The sky is red"
   ```

Note: The interpretation depends on the base word:
- Action roots → active verbs (ter "flow", thren "watch")
- Property roots → stative verbs (thral "sacred", mar "red")
- Some roots can function both ways depending on context

[Note: The -er suffix appears in Middle Hick through Old Iutlandish contact, 
leading to the occupational/active distinction between -ok/-er in Late Hick]

## Derivational Morphology
   2. Directional Cases (-aes/-imris):  
### Similarity Prefix
      red sky.ABS blue.ILL  
- ka- [kə]: prefix meaning "like, similar to"
- Always surfaces as [kə-] due to regular vowel reduction Examples:
- ka-tor [kə.tor] "hill-like" (smaller than a mountain)
- ka-mal [kə.mal] "pond-like" (smaller than a lake)
- ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)
      "blue sky turns back red"  
### Negation System
      red sky.ABS blue.ILL  
- mo- [mo]: general negation prefix Examples:
- mo-thral "non-sacred, profane"
- mo-ter "not flowing, stagnant"
- mo-ward "misdirect, lead astray"
   - Causatives marked by adding ergative agent
### Compound Formation
## Derivational Morphology
- Basic Pattern: modifier-head
- Sound changes:
  - Liquid deletion: tor-mal → tomal
  - Nasal deletion: bram-mal → bramal Examples:
- kur-tin → kurtin "bronze" (copper-tin)
- bram-mater → brammater "river vessel" (tide-vessel)
- thral-kel → thrakel "sun" (sacred-sky)
- ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)
### Body Metaphors
### Negation System
1. Breath as the soul
2. Liver as source of life
3. Heart as source of emotion
4. Bones as structure
5. Hands as tools
6. Eyes as reality
7. Skin as appearance
### Negation System
## Affix Order
- Sound changes:
### Basic Template
  - Nasal deletion: bram-mal → bramal Examples:
1. Root Structure
- bram-mater → brammater "river vessel" (tide-vessel)

## Verbal Morphology

### Verbalizer

- -ʔer [ʔer]: creates verbs from nouns and property concepts 
  (See: [Adjectival Morphology](#adjectival-morphology))

1. Active verbs (from action/motion concepts):
   ```plaintext
   ai-es ter-ʔer
   water-ABS flow-VERB
   "Water flows"
   
   murmer-is-el sak-es thren-ʔer
   owl-PROX.ANIM-ERG wolf-ABS watch-VERB
   "This owl watches the wolf"
   ```

2. Stative verbs (from property concepts):
   ```plaintext
   tor-thir-es thral-ʔer
   peak-KNOWN.ANIM-ABS sacred-VERB
   "The known peak is sacred"
   ```

Note: The interpretation depends on the base word:
- Action roots → active verbs (ter "flow", thren "watch")
- Property roots → stative verbs (thral "sacred", mar "red")
- Some roots can function both ways depending on context

### Interaction with Case System

1. Active Verbs:
   - Take ergative agent and absolutive patient
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     materok-el kethmater-im-ris keth-es ward-ter
     boatman-ERG sea.vessel-PROX-ELL sea-ABS direct-to
     "The boatman takes the sea vessel to the ocean"
     ```

2. Stative Verbs:
   - Take absolutive argument only
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     mal-thir-es thral-ʔer
     pool-KNOWN.ANIM-ABS sacred-VERB
     "The known pool is sacred"
     ```

[Note: The -er suffix appears in Middle Hick through Old Iutlandish contact, 
leading to the occupational/active distinction between -ok/-er in Late Hick]

## User:


[text]  
next please


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the code, I notice we need to revise the Tense and Aspect Marking section to align with the syntax examples shown in:


````1047:1117:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
     branum materok-el ward-ʔer  # Frame-setting
# Syntax
     "In the past, the handler guided"
## Clause Structure and Word Order
     materok-el branum ward-ʔer  # Temporal contrast
1. Basic Patterns
     "The handler USED TO guide"
   - Core arguments marked by case, allowing flexible word order
   - Ergative (-el) marks agent of transitive verbs
   - Absolutive (-es) marks patient of transitive & sole argument of
     intransitive
   - Word order signals pragmatic functions rather than grammatical roles
     intransitive
2. Information Structure
   - Final position: new information or emphasis
   - Initial position: topic/focus or temporal frame
   - Final position: new information or emphasis
   - Examples:
     branum bramisimris kethes
     ```plaintext
     branum bramisimris kethes
     past    river-ELL    sea-ABS
     "In the past, the river flowed to the sea" (temporal frame first)
     sea-ABS river-ELL    past
     kethes bramisimris branum
     sea-ABS river-ELL    past
     "The river flowed to the sea, in the past" (neutral statement)
     ```
     "The river flowed to the sea, in the past" (neutral statement)
3. Verb Position and Aspect

   - Verbs can occur in different positions based on aspect:
     materok-el rismater-es ward tel
     ```plaintext
     materok-el rismater-es ward tel
     handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide COMPL
     "The handler has guided the reed boat" (completed action)
     reed.boat-ABS guide sea-ABS
     rismater-es ward kethes
     reed.boat-ABS guide sea-ABS
     "The reed boat guides to sea" (general statement)
     ```
     ```plaintext
   - Directional constructions allow goal prominence:
     ```plaintext
     keth-aes materok-el rismater-es
     sea-ILL  handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS
     "To sea the handler (takes) the reed boat"
     ```
     "To sea the handler (takes) the reed boat"
4. Temporal Reference
     - Initial: setting temporal frame for discourse
   - Time words can float freely but tend toward:
     - Initial: setting temporal frame for discourse
     - Pre-verbal: marking temporal contrast
     - Final: neutral narrative position
   - Examples:
     branum materok-el ward-ʔer  # Frame-setting
     ```plaintext
     branum materok-el ward-ʔer  # Frame-setting
     past    handler-ERG guide-ACT
     "In the past, the handler guided"
     handler-ERG past    guide-ACT
     materok-el branum ward-ʔer  # Temporal contrast
     handler-ERG past    guide-ACT
     "The handler USED TO guide"
     handler-ERG guide-ACT past
     materok-el ward-ʔer branum  # Neutral narrative
     handler-ERG guide-ACT past
     "The handler guided, in the past"
     ```
````


Here's my proposed revision:

````markdown
### Tense and Aspect Marking

1. Basic Temporal Markers
   - branum [bra.num] "past" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.INAN")
     - From bran "dawn" + -um "distal inanimate"
     - Used for general past reference and historical narratives
   
   - branrum [bran.rum] "ancestral time" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.ANIM")
     - Uses animate distal marker -rum to personify ancestral time
     - Specifically for sacred histories and ancestral stories
   
   - mulsum [mul.sum] "future" (lit. "night-change-DIST")
     - From mulsimrum "changes to a distant night"
     - Used for predictions and intentions

2. Completive Marking
   - tel [tel] "complete, finished"
     - Follows clause for past perfect meaning
     - Example:
       ```plaintext
       materok-el rismater-es ward tel
       handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide COMPL
       "The handler has guided the reed boat"
       ```

3. Position and Usage
   - Initial position (topic/focus):
     ```plaintext
     branum materok-el ward-ʔer
     past    handler-ERG guide-ACT
     "In the past, the handler guided"
     ```
   
   - Pre-verbal position (temporal contrast):
     ```plaintext
     materok-el branum ward-ʔer
     handler-ERG past    guide-ACT
     "The handler USED TO guide"
     ```
   
   - Final position (neutral narrative):
     ```plaintext
     materok-el ward-ʔer branum
     handler-ERG guide-ACT past
     "The handler guided, in the past"
     ```

Note: Time words can occur in any position, but their placement affects discourse 
function and emphasis.

## User:


[text]  
I'm not sure why you propose to remove descriptive text that explains how the tense and aspect markers may have developed


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

You're absolutely right - I apologize. Looking at the code (lines 377-388), the etymological and cultural information about the temporal markers is important for understanding their development and usage.

Here's my revised proposal for the Tense and Aspect section that preserves those details:

````markdown
### Tense and Aspect Marking

1. Basic Temporal Markers
   - branum [bra.num] "past" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.INAN")
     - From bran "dawn" + -um "distal inanimate"
     - Conceptualizes past as distant dawn-time, reflecting Hick cultural view
       of time flowing from dawn to night
     - Used for general past reference and historical narratives
   
   - branrum [bran.rum] "ancestral time" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.ANIM")
     - Uses animate distal marker -rum to personify ancestral time
     - Specifically used for sacred histories and ancestral stories
     - Contrasts with branum by marking time as animate/sacred
   
   - mulsum [mul.sum] "future" (lit. "night-change-DIST")
     - From mulsimrum "changes to a distant night"
     - Grammaticalized through reduction: mulsimrum → mulsum
     - Reflects Hick metaphor of future as approaching darkness
     - Used for both predictions and intentions

2. Completive Marking
   - tel [tel] "complete, finished"
     - Follows clause for past perfect meaning
     - Derives from Proto-Hick *telu "place/position"
     - Metaphorical extension: reaching a place → completion
     - Example:
       ```plaintext
       materok-el rismater-es ward tel
       handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide COMPL
       "The handler has guided the reed boat"
       ```

3. Position and Usage
   - Initial position (topic/focus):
     ```plaintext
     branum materok-el ward-ʔer
     past    handler-ERG guide-ACT
     "In the past, the handler guided"
     ```
   
   - Pre-verbal position (temporal contrast):
     ```plaintext
     materok-el branum ward-ʔer
     handler-ERG past    guide-ACT
     "The handler USED TO guide"
     ```
   
   - Final position (neutral narrative):
     ```plaintext
     materok-el ward-ʔer branum
     handler-ERG guide-ACT past
     "The handler guided, in the past"
     ```

Note: Time words can occur in any position, but their placement affects discourse 
function and emphasis.

## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Looking at the code, I see we need to revise the Directional System section next, which appears in multiple places. Let's consolidate the information from:


```310:317:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
2. Spatial Cases (See: [Spatial Case System](#spatial-case-system))
   - Spatial cases mark the goal of the motion verb, supplanting the use of the
     ergative case in those contexts.
     - -aes (ILL): "inward, into"
     - -imris (ELL): "outward, from"
     - -itar (SUPE): "upward, upon"
     - -esp (SUB): "under, below"
     - -asam (SUBE): "downward, onto"
```


and


````940:960:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
### Directional System
```
1. Basic Directionals
Examples:
   - -aes: illative "inward, into"
   - -imris: ellative "outward, from"
   - -itar: superlative "upward"
   - -asam: sublative "downward"
1. Outer Prefixes (first position)
2. Example Usage
   - ma- (PL): plural
   - materokel rismateraes "the boatman enters the reed boat"
   - materokel rismaterimris "the boatman exits the reed boat"
   - materokel rismateritar "the boatman climbs onto the reed boat"
   - materokel rismaterasam "the boatman climbs down from the reed boat"
   - tor- (AUG): augmentative
3. Notes:
   - Directional cases imply motion verbs
   - Ergative (-el) marks the agent
   - No additional case marking needed on the goal/source when using
     directionals
````


Here's my proposed consolidated version:

````markdown
### Directional System

1. Basic Directionals
   - -aes [aes] (ILL): "inward, into"
   - -imris [im.ris] (ELL): "outward, from"
   - -itar [i.tar] (SUPE): "upward, upon"
   - -esp [esp] (SUB): "under, below"
   - -asam [a.sam] (SUBE): "downward, onto"

2. Example Usage
   ```plaintext
   materok-el rismater-aes
   handler-ERG reed.boat-ILL
   "The handler enters the reed boat"

   materok-el rismater-imris
   handler-ERG reed.boat-ELL
   "The handler exits the reed boat"

   materok-el rismater-itar
   handler-ERG reed.boat-SUPE
   "The handler climbs onto the reed boat"

   materok-el rismater-asam
   handler-ERG reed.boat-SUBE
   "The handler climbs down from the reed boat"
   ```

3. Syntactic Properties
   - Directional cases imply motion verbs
   - Ergative (-el) marks the agent
   - No additional case marking needed on the goal/source
   - Can be fronted for emphasis:
     ```plaintext
     keth-aes materok-el rismater-es
     sea-ILL  handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS
     "To sea the handler (takes) the reed boat"

Would you like me to propose a consolidated version of these sections, maintaining all unique information while eliminating redundancy?

## User:


[text]  
can you compare the ones specifically the duplicate subsections in morphology, to see if there are differing content?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

I'll analyze the duplicate sections in Morphology and note any differences in content. Here are the main duplicates:

### Tense and Aspect Marking
   - -ʔer [ʔer]: creates active verbs
1. Basic Temporal Markers
   - ter-ʔer "to flow" (flow-ACT)
   - branum [bra.num] "past" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.INAN")
     - From bran "dawn" + -um "distal inanimate"
     - Conceptualizes past as distant dawn-time, reflecting Hick cultural view
       of time flowing from dawn to night
     - Used for general past reference and historical narratives
   - branrum [bran.rum] "ancestral time" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.ANIM")
     - Uses animate distal marker -rum to personify ancestral time
     - Specifically used for sacred histories and ancestral stories
     - Contrasts with branum by marking time as animate/sacred
   - mulsum [mul.sum] "future" (lit. "night-change-DIST")
     - From mulsimrum "changes to a distant night"
     - Grammaticalized through reduction: mulsimrum → mulsum
     - Reflects Hick metaphor of future as approaching darkness
     - Used for both predictions and intentions
### Tense and Aspect Marking
2. Completive Marking
1. Basic Temporal Markers
   - tel [tel] "complete, finished"
     - Follows clause for past perfect meaning
     - Derives from Proto-Hick \*telu "place/position"
     - Metaphorical extension: reaching a place → completion
     - Example: bramisimris kethes branum tel "the river had flowed to the sea"
     - Used for general past reference and historical narratives
3. Position and Usage
     - Uses animate distal marker -rum to personify ancestral time
   - Sentence-initial (topic/focus):
     - Marks temporal frame for entire discourse
     - Often used in formal/ritual speech
     - Example: branum bramisimris kethes "In the past, the river flowed to the
       sea"
   - Sentence-final (neutral):
     - Default narrative position
     - Most common in everyday speech
     - Example: bramisimris kethes branum "The river flowed to the sea"
   - Pre-verbal (emphasis):
     - Marks temporal contrast
     - Used for emphasis or correction
     - Example: bramisimris branum kethes "The river USED TO flow to sea"

Here's my proposed consolidated version for the Verbal Morphology section:

## Verbal Morphology

### Verbalizer

- -ʔer [ʔer]: creates verbs from nouns and property concepts

1. Active verbs (from action/motion concepts):
   ```plaintext
   ai-es ter-ʔer
   water-ABS flow-VERB
   "Water flows"

   murmer-is-el sak-es thren-ʔer
   owl-PROX.ANIM-ERG wolf-ABS watch-VERB
   "This owl watches the wolf"
   ```

2. Stative verbs (from property concepts):
   ```plaintext
   tor-thir-es thral-ʔer
   peak-KNOWN.ANIM-ABS sacred-VERB
   "The known peak is sacred"

   kel-es mar-ʔer
   sky-ABS red-VERB
   "The sky is red"
   ```

Note: The interpretation depends on the base word:
- Action roots → active verbs (ter "flow", thren "watch")
- Property roots → stative verbs (thral "sacred", mar "red")
- Some roots can function both ways depending on context

[Note: The -er suffix appears in Middle Hick through Old Iutlandish contact, 
leading to the occupational/active distinction between -ok/-er in Late Hick]

### Interaction with Case System

1. Active Verbs:
   - Take ergative agent and absolutive patient
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     materok-el kethmater-im-ris keth-es ward-ter
     boatman-ERG sea.vessel-PROX-ELL sea-ABS direct-to
     "The boatman takes the sea vessel to the ocean"
     ```

2. Stative Verbs:
   - Take absolutive argument only
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     mal-thir-es thral-ʔer
     pool-KNOWN.ANIM-ABS sacred-VERB
     "The known pool is sacred"
     ```

You're right - let's keep and add cross-references. Looking at the verbal morphology section, I notice several places where we should add cross-references to related sections and lexical entries.

Here's how we can consolidate the verbal sections while maintaining and adding cross-references:

```markdown
## Verbal Morphology

### Verbalizer

- -ʔer [ʔer]: creates verbs from nouns and property concepts 
  (See: [Sound Changes in Compounds](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/compounds.md))

1. Active verbs (from action/motion concepts):
   - ter-ʔer "to flow" (See: [Water Features](#water-features), line 370)
   - thren-ʔer "to watch" (See: [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual))
   ```plaintext
   ai-es ter-ʔer
   water-ABS flow-VERB
   "Water flows"
   ```

2. Stative verbs (from property concepts):
   - thral-ʔer "to be sacred" (See: [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual))
   - mar-ʔer "to be red" (See: [Colors](#colors), line 367)
   ```plaintext
   kel-es mar-ʔer
   sky-ABS red-VERB
   "The sky is red"
   ```

Note: The interpretation depends on the base word:
- Action roots → active verbs (ter "flow", thren "watch")
- Property roots → stative verbs (thral "sacred", mar "red")
- Some roots can function both ways depending on context
(See: [Lexical Categories](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/lexicon.md))

### Tense and Aspect Marking

1. Basic Temporal Markers
   - branum [bra.num] "past" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.INAN")
     (See: [Time Terms](#time--celestial))
     - From bran "dawn" + -um "distal inanimate"
     - Conceptualizes past as distant dawn-time
     - Used for general past reference and historical narratives
   
   - branrum [bran.rum] "ancestral time" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.ANIM")
     (See: [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual))
     - Uses animate distal marker -rum to personify ancestral time
     - Specifically used for sacred histories and ancestral stories

   - mulsum [mul.sum] "future" (lit. "night-change-DIST")
     (See: [Time Terms](#time--celestial))
     - From mulsimrum "changes to a distant night"
     - Grammaticalized through reduction: mulsimrum → mulsum
     - Used for both predictions and intentions
```

Would you like me to continue with the rest of the verbal morphology sections, maintaining all cross-references?

## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

I'll continue consolidating the verbal morphology sections while maintaining cross-references. Looking at the code blocks, I can see the relevant sections are spread across these line ranges:


```332:374:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

### Tense and Aspect Marking
   - -ʔer [ʔer]: creates active verbs
1. Basic Temporal Markers
   - ter-ʔer "to flow" (flow-ACT)
   - branum [bra.num] "past" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.INAN")
     - From bran "dawn" + -um "distal inanimate"
     - Conceptualizes past as distant dawn-time, reflecting Hick cultural view
       of time flowing from dawn to night
     - Used for general past reference and historical narratives
   - branrum [bran.rum] "ancestral time" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.ANIM")
     - Uses animate distal marker -rum to personify ancestral time
     - Specifically used for sacred histories and ancestral stories
     - Contrasts with branum by marking time as animate/sacred
   - mulsum [mul.sum] "future" (lit. "night-change-DIST")
     - From mulsimrum "changes to a distant night"
     - Grammaticalized through reduction: mulsimrum → mulsum
     - Reflects Hick metaphor of future as approaching darkness
     - Used for both predictions and intentions
### Tense and Aspect Marking
2. Completive Marking
1. Basic Temporal Markers
   - tel [tel] "complete, finished"
     - Follows clause for past perfect meaning
     - Derives from Proto-Hick \*telu "place/position"
     - Metaphorical extension: reaching a place → completion
     - Example: bramisimris kethes branum tel "the river had flowed to the sea"
     - Used for general past reference and historical narratives
3. Position and Usage
     - Uses animate distal marker -rum to personify ancestral time
   - Sentence-initial (topic/focus):
     - Marks temporal frame for entire discourse
     - Often used in formal/ritual speech
     - Example: branum bramisimris kethes "In the past, the river flowed to the
       sea"
   - Sentence-final (neutral):
     - Default narrative position
     - Most common in everyday speech
     - Example: bramisimris kethes branum "The river flowed to the sea"
   - Pre-verbal (emphasis):
     - Marks temporal contrast
     - Used for emphasis or correction
     - Example: bramisimris branum kethes "The river USED TO flow to sea"
```

### Spatial Reference System
   - branum [bra.num] "past" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.INAN")
1. Basic Spatial Markers
     - Conceptualizes past as distant dawn-time, reflecting Hick cultural view

   - ris (archaic locative): "from, away" Examples:
   - is-ran "at this place"
   - eth-ran "at that place"

Early Hick's directional system marks the goal of the motion verb, supplanting
the use of the ergative case in those contexts.
### Spatial Reference System
1. Basic Directionals
   - -aes: illative "inward, into"

Would you like me to continue with other sections of verbal morphology?

## User:


[text]  
why is the weight distribution section referenced in "Position and Usage"?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the content, the Weight Distribution section (lines 152-176) is not actually relevant to the Position and Usage section of temporal markers (lines 408-430). The Weight Distribution section deals with stress patterns in compounds, while Position and Usage deals with word order and discourse functions.

Instead, this section should reference:
1. The Prosodic System section (lines 177-192) for stress patterns in temporal expressions
2. The Clause Structure section (which appears to be missing from the provided code) for word order principles

I suggest removing the Weight Distribution reference and adding these more relevant cross-references. Here's where the relevant sections appear:


```408:430:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - ter-ʔer "to flow" (flow-ACT)
   - thral-ʔer "to be sacred" (sacred-ACT)
   - thren-ʔer "to watch" (watch-ACT)
1. Basic Connectors
### Spatial Case System
   - is "and" (sequential)
Early Hick's directional system marks the goal of the motion verb, supplanting
the use of the ergative case in those contexts.
### Spatial Reference System
1. Basic Directionals
   - -aes: illative "inward, into"
   - -imris: ellative "outward, from"
   - -itar: superessive "upward, upon"
   - -asam: subessive "downward, onto"
   - -esp: sublative "under, below"
   - -sim: translative "change of state, become"
   - Examples:
     - keth-aes "into the sea"
     - keth-imris "from the sea"
     - tor-itar "upward to the peak"
     - tor-asam "downward from the peak"
2. Complex Directionals
   - -aes-imris: translative "change of state, become"
```


Should I propose a revised version of the Position and Usage section with more appropriate cross-references?

## User:


[text]  
clause structure is still a WIP, but yes please propose more appropriate cross references


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the Position and Usage section (lines 408-430), I see it should reference:

1. Clause Structure and Word Order (lines 837-882) for basic word order patterns
2. Information Structure (lines 847-861) for pragmatic functions
3. Verb Position and Aspect (lines 863-882) for aspect-based positioning

Here's my proposed revision with appropriate cross-references:

```markdown
3. Position and Usage
   (See: [Clause Structure and Word Order](#clause-structure-and-word-order),
   [Information Structure](#information-structure))

   - Initial position (topic/focus):
     - Marks temporal frame for entire discourse
     - Often used in formal/ritual speech
     ```plaintext
     branum materok-el ward-ʔer
     past    handler-ERG guide-ACT
     "In the past, the handler guided"
     ```

   - Pre-verbal position (temporal contrast):
     - Marks temporal contrast
     - Used for emphasis or correction
     (See: [Verb Position and Aspect](#verb-position-and-aspect))
     ```plaintext

     ```plaintext

     ```

Note: Position interacts with aspect marking and information structure.

### Spatial Reference System
   - branum [bra.num] "past" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.INAN")
1. Basic Spatial Markers
     - Conceptualizes past as distant dawn-time, reflecting Hick cultural view
   - ran (archaic locative): "at, in"
   - ris (archaic locative): "from, away" Examples:
   - is-ran "at this place"
   - eth-ran "at that place"
   - um-ris "away from that place"
   - Sentence-final (neutral):
2. Spatial Demonstratives
   - istel-ʔal "this.place-person" (speaker's location)
   - ethtel-ʔal "that.place-person" (addressee's location)
   - umtel-ʔal "far.place-person" (third party location)
     - Marks temporal contrast
### Conjunctions
     - Example: bramisimris branum kethes "The river USED TO flow to sea"
1. Basic Connectors
### Spatial Reference System
   - is "and" (sequential)
   - eth "and" (simultaneous)
   - um "or"
   - ran (archaic locative): "at, in"
2. Complex Connectors
   - ishis [is.his] "and then"
   - ethis [eθ.is] "while"
   - umis [um.is] "or else"
     - Marks temporal frame for entire discourse
### Verbal System
   - istel-ʔal "this.place-person" (speaker's location)
1. Basic Verbalizer
   - -ʔer [ʔer]: creates active verbs Examples:
   - ter-ʔer "to flow" (flow-ACT)
   - thral-ʔer "to be sacred" (sacred-ACT)
   - thren-ʔer "to watch" (watch-ACT)
1. Basic Connectors
### Spatial Case System
   - is "and" (sequential)
Early Hick's directional system marks the goal of the motion verb, supplanting
the use of the ergative case in those contexts.
### Spatial Reference System
1. Basic Directionals
   - -aes: illative "inward, into"
   - -imris: ellative "outward, from"
   - -itar: superessive "upward, upon"
   - -asam: subessive "downward, onto"
   - -esp: sublative "under, below"
   - -sim: translative "change of state, become"
   - Examples:
     - keth-aes "into the sea"
     - keth-imris "from the sea"
     - tor-itar "upward to the peak"
     - tor-asam "downward from the peak"
2. Complex Directionals
   - -aes-imris: translative "change of state, become"
     - formal, reduced to shorter -sim
Early Hick's directional system marks the goal of the motion verb, supplanting
## Nominal Morphology
   - ter-ʔer "to flow" (flow-ACT)
### Size and Intensity Markers
   - -aes: illative "inward, into"
1. Diminutive (li-)
   - -itar: superessive "upward, upon"
   - Prefix meaning "small, lesser"
   - Examples:
     - limal [li.mal] "small pool, pond"
     - liren [li.ren] "small deer, fawn"
     - lines [li.nes] "small fish, minnow"
     - keth-imris "from the sea"
2. Augmentative (tor-)
   - Prefix meaning "great, mighty" (from "height, peak")
   - Examples:
     - tornes [tor.nes] "great fish, whale"
```


4. A duplicate appears in:

````631:649:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
### Basic Template
  - Nasal deletion: bram-mal → bramal Examples:
1. Root Structure
- bram-mater → brammater "river vessel" (tide-vessel)
   - (PREFIX*) + ROOT + (SUFFIX*)
   - Maximum of three prefixes and two suffixes
### Body Metaphors
2. Order of Elements
1. Breath as the soul
     ```plaintext
(NEG)-(SIZE)-(SIM)-ROOT-(AGENT)-(CASE)

Here's my proposed consolidated structure:

```markdown
## Verbal Morphology

### Verbalizer
[Keep content from lines 332-374, which has more detailed examples]

The key changes would be:
1. Remove the duplicate Verbal System section (478-485)
2. Remove the duplicate Tense/Aspect section (631-649)
3. Keep all cross-references to:

## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

I'll proceed with implementing the consolidated Verbal Morphology section, using the cross-references from the provided code blocks.

```markdown
## Verbal Morphology

### Verbalizer

- -ʔer [ʔer]: creates verbs from nouns and property concepts
  (See: [Historical Development](#historical-development), lines 34-67)

1. Active verbs:
   ```plaintext
   ai-es ter-ʔer
   water-ABS flow-VERB
   "Water flows"

   materok-el ʔal-es ward-ʔer
   handler-ERG person-ABS guide-VERB
   "The handler guides the person"
   ```
   (See: [Core Grammar](#core-grammar), lines 289-313)

2. Stative verbs:
   ```plaintext
   tor-thir-es thral-ʔer
   peak-KNOWN.ANIM-ABS sacred-VERB
   "The known peak is sacred"
   ```
   (See: [Sacred Terms](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/lexicon.md#sacred--ritual))

Note: Interpretation depends on base word semantics:
- Action/motion roots → active verbs (ter "flow", ward "guide")
- Property roots → stative verbs (thral "sacred")
(See: [Basic Terms](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/lexicon.md#basic-terms), lines 24-34)

### Tense and Aspect Marking

1. Basic Temporal Markers
   (See: [Temporal Reference](#temporal-reference), lines 901-921)
   - branum [bra.num] "past" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.INAN")
     - From bran "dawn" + -um "distal inanimate"
     - Used for general past reference and historical narratives
   - branrum [bran.rum] "ancestral time" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.ANIM")
     - Uses animate distal marker for sacred histories
   - mulsum [mul.sum] "future" (lit. "night-change-DIST")
     - From mulsimrum → mulsum (See: [Sound Changes](#sound-changes))

2. Position and Usage
   (See: [Information Structure](#information-structure), lines 864-879)
   - Initial: sets temporal frame
   - Pre-verbal: marks temporal contrast
   - Final: neutral narrative position

### Interaction with Case System

(See: [Case System](#case-system), lines 291-313)
- Ergative-absolutive alignment
- Spatial cases replace ergative with motion verbs
- Examples:
  ```plaintext
  materok-el rismater-es ward-ʔer
  handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide-VERB
  "The handler guides the reed boat"

  keth-aes materok-el rismater-es
  sea-ILL  handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS
  "To sea the handler (takes) the reed boat"
  ```

### Directional System

(See: [Clause Structure and Word Order](#clause-structure-and-word-order), 
lines 854-863)
- Marks goal of motion verbs
- Interacts with information structure through fronting
- Basic directionals:
  - -aes (ILL): "inward, into"
  - -imris (ELL): "outward, from"
  - -itar (SUP): "upward, upon"
  - -asam (SUB): "downward, onto"
```

Would you like me to continue with any specific section in more detail?

## User:


[text]  
for the cross-reference on the verbalizer, I think there is a more relevant link to @proto-hick.md 


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, looking at the code blocks, I see that the verbalizer -ʔer has important historical information in the Proto-Hick document. The current cross-reference to Historical Development is less relevant than linking to the Proto-Hick section that explains its origins.

Specifically, these sections are relevant:


```165:177:site/content/languages/hick/proto-hick.md

   b. \*x > h / #\_

   - \*xalu > halu > al "rock"
   - \*xiru > hiru > ir "iron"

9. Final Vowel Loss
   - \*-u > ∅ / \_#
   - Extremely regular:
     - \*thralu → thral "sacred"
     - \*malu → mal "pool"
     - \*toru → tor "height"
     - \*wadu → wad "path"
```


And:


```328:329:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
[Note: The -er suffix appears in Middle Hick through Old Iutlandish
contact, leading to the occupational/active distinction between -ok/-er in Late Hick]
```


I suggest updating the verbalizer section's cross-reference to:
`(See: [Proto-Hick](@/languages/hick/proto-hick.md#proto-hick-features))`

This would better document the historical development of the -ʔer verbalizer from Proto-Hick *hi-er through Old Iutlandish contact.

Would you like me to show the revised verbalizer section with this updated cross-reference?

## User:


[text]  
yes please. also, I don't think we need to refer to middle hick -er right now, unless we want to note that -er is not the same as early hick ʔer 


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

You're right - we should focus on Early Hick's -ʔer verbalizer and its Proto-Hick origins, without getting into Middle Hick developments yet.

Looking at the Proto-Hick document, the relevant sections are:


```328:342:site/content/languages/hick/proto-hick.md

```


Here's my revised verbalizer section:

```markdown
### Verbalizer

- -ʔer [ʔer]: creates verbs from nouns and property concepts
  (See: [Proto-Hick](@/languages/hick/proto-hick.md#animacy-marking))

1. Active verbs:
   ```plaintext
   ai-es ter-ʔer
   water-ABS flow-VERB
   "Water flows"

   materok-el ʔal-es ward-ʔer
   handler-ERG person-ABS guide-VERB
   "The handler guides the person"
   ```

2. Stative verbs:
   ```plaintext
   tor-thir-es thral-ʔer
   peak-KNOWN.ANIM-ABS sacred-VERB
   "The known peak is sacred"
   ```

Note: Interpretation depends on base word semantics:
- Action/motion roots → active verbs (ter "flow", ward "guide")
- Property roots → stative verbs (thral "sacred")
(See: [Basic Terms](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/lexicon.md#basic-terms))

```

This revision:
1. Links directly to Proto-Hick's animacy marking section which explains the origin of -ʔer
2. Removes the potentially confusing Middle Hick note
3. Maintains the key examples and semantic distinctions

Would you like me to continue with the other sections?

## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the code blocks, I see we need to consolidate the verbal morphology sections. There are two main instances of the verbalizer section:


```332:377:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

### Tense and Aspect Marking
   - -ʔer [ʔer]: creates active verbs
1. Basic Temporal Markers
   - ter-ʔer "to flow" (flow-ACT)
   - branum [bra.num] "past" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.INAN")
     - From bran "dawn" + -um "distal inanimate"
     - Conceptualizes past as distant dawn-time, reflecting Hick cultural view
       of time flowing from dawn to night
     - Used for general past reference and historical narratives
   - branrum [bran.rum] "ancestral time" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.ANIM")
     - Uses animate distal marker -rum to personify ancestral time
     - Specifically used for sacred histories and ancestral stories
     - Contrasts with branum by marking time as animate/sacred
   - mulsum [mul.sum] "future" (lit. "night-change-DIST")
     - From mulsimrum "changes to a distant night"
     - Grammaticalized through reduction: mulsimrum → mulsum
     - Reflects Hick metaphor of future as approaching darkness
     - Used for both predictions and intentions
### Tense and Aspect Marking
2. Completive Marking
1. Basic Temporal Markers
   - tel [tel] "complete, finished"
     - Follows clause for past perfect meaning
     - Derives from Proto-Hick \*telu "place/position"
     - Metaphorical extension: reaching a place → completion
     - Example: bramisimris kethes branum tel "the river had flowed to the sea"
     - Used for general past reference and historical narratives
3. Position and Usage
     - Uses animate distal marker -rum to personify ancestral time
   - Sentence-initial (topic/focus):
     - Marks temporal frame for entire discourse
     - Often used in formal/ritual speech
     - Example: branum bramisimris kethes "In the past, the river flowed to the
       sea"
   - Sentence-final (neutral):
     - Default narrative position
     - Most common in everyday speech
     - Example: bramisimris kethes branum "The river flowed to the sea"
   - Pre-verbal (emphasis):
     - Marks temporal contrast
     - Used for emphasis or correction
     - Example: bramisimris branum kethes "The river USED TO flow to sea"
     - Metaphorical extension: reaching a place → completion
### Spatial Reference System
   - branum [bra.num] "past" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.INAN")
```

and

```602:627:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
### Negation System
      red sky.ABS blue.ILL  
- mo- [mo]: general negation prefix Examples:
- mo-thral "non-sacred, profane"
- mo-ter "not flowing, stagnant"
- mo-ward "misdirect, lead astray"
   - Causatives marked by adding ergative agent
### Compound Formation
## Derivational Morphology
- Basic Pattern: modifier-head
- Sound changes:
  - Liquid deletion: tor-mal → tomal
  - Nasal deletion: bram-mal → bramal Examples:
- kur-tin → kurtin "bronze" (copper-tin)
- bram-mater → brammater "river vessel" (tide-vessel)
- thral-kel → thrakel "sun" (sacred-sky)
- ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)
### Body Metaphors
### Negation System
1. Breath as the soul
2. Liver as source of life
3. Heart as source of emotion
4. Bones as structure
5. Hands as tools
6. Eyes as reality
7. Skin as appearance
```

Here's my proposed consolidated version:

```markdown
### Verbalizer

- -ʔer [ʔer]: creates verbs from nouns and property concepts
  (See: [Proto-Hick](@/languages/hick/proto-hick.md#animacy-marking))

1. Active verbs (from action/motion concepts):

   ```plaintext
   ai-es ter-ʔer
   water-ABS flow-VERB
   "Water flows"

   murmer-is-el sak-es thren-ʔer
   owl-PROX.ANIM-ERG wolf-ABS watch-VERB
   "This owl watches the wolf"
   ```

   Examples:

- ter-ʔer "to flow" (See: [Water Features](#water-features))
- thren-ʔer "to watch" (See: [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual))
- ward-ʔer "to guide"

2. Stative verbs (from property concepts):

   ```plaintext
   tor-thir-es thral-ʔer
   peak-KNOWN.ANIM-ABS sacred-VERB
   "The known peak is sacred"
   ```

   Examples:
   - thral-ʔer "to be sacred" (See: [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual))
   - mar-ʔer "to be red" (See: [Colors](#colors))

Note: Interpretation depends on base word semantics:

- Action/motion roots → active verbs (ter "flow", ward "guide")
- Property roots → stative verbs (thral "sacred")
(See: [Basic Terms](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/lexicon.md#basic-terms))

```

Would you like me to continue with consolidating the other verbal morphology sections?

## User:


[text]  
Also we should probably use ' for glottal stops in the phonemic/orthographical transcription instead of IPA ? let's only use IPA in phonological transcriptions


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, you're right about using ' for glottal stops in phonemic/orthographic transcriptions and reserving ʔ for phonetic transcriptions. Looking at the code blocks, I see this pattern needs to be applied consistently.

Let's revise the verbalizer section with this convention:

```markdown
### Verbalizer

- -'er ['er]: creates verbs from nouns and property concepts
  (See: [Proto-Hick](@/languages/hick/proto-hick.md#animacy-marking))

1. Active verbs:
   ```plaintext
   ai-es ter-'er
   water-ABS flow-VERB
   "Water flows"

   materok-el 'al-es ward-'er
   handler-ERG person-ABS guide-VERB
   "The handler guides the person"
   ```

2. Stative verbs:

   ```plaintext
   tor-thir-es thral-'er
   peak-KNOWN.ANIM-ABS sacred-VERB
   "The known peak is sacred"
   ```

Note: Interpretation depends on base word semantics:

- Action/motion roots → active verbs (ter "flow", ward "guide")
- Property roots → stative verbs (thral "sacred")
(See: [Basic Terms](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/lexicon.md#basic-terms))

```

This revision:
1. Changes ʔ to ' in phonemic transcriptions
2. Maintains ʔ in any phonetic transcriptions (when discussing pronunciation)
3. Keeps the same examples but with updated orthography

The relevant sections I referenced are:

```91:92:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
Note: The glottal stop is written as <'> in phonemic transcription and [ʔ] in
phonetic transcription.
```

Which establishes the orthographic convention, and:

```334:376:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

Which contains the original verbalizer section.

Would you like me to continue updating other sections to maintain this orthographic convention?

## User:


[text]  
In the Core Grammar section, we have a Verbal System subsection, perhaps we should just reference the Verbal Morphology section there?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, you're right. Looking at the code blocks, we have duplicate verbal morphology content in two places:

1. Under Core Grammar:

```483:489:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
1. Plural Prefix (ma-)
1. Visible/Known
   - -is [is] "this" (inanimate)
   - -ʔis [ʔis] "this" (animate)
   - -en [en] "that" (inanimate)
   - -tan [tan] "that" (animate)
2. Hidden but Sensed
```


2. The main Verbal Morphology section:

````597:682:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
- Always surfaces as [kə-] due to regular vowel reduction Examples:
- ka-tor [kə.tor] "hill-like" (smaller than a mountain)
- ka-mal [kə.mal] "pond-like" (smaller than a lake)
- ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)

### Compound Formation
## Derivational Morphology
- Basic Pattern: modifier-head
- Sound changes:
  - Liquid deletion: tor-mal → tomal
  - Nasal deletion: bram-mal → bramal Examples:
- kur-tin → kurtin "bronze" (copper-tin)
- bram-mater → brammater "river vessel" (tide-vessel)
- thral-kel → thrakel "sun" (sacred-sky)
- ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)
### Body Metaphors

I suggest replacing the Core Grammar's Verbal System subsection with a simple reference:

```markdown
### Verbal System

See: [Verbal Morphology](#verbal-morphology) for details on:
- Verbalizer -'er
- Tense and aspect marking
- Case system interaction
- Directional system
```

This would:
1. Remove the duplicate content
2. Maintain the logical structure of the document
3. Direct readers to the comprehensive section
4. Keep the Core Grammar section focused on fundamental patterns

Would you like me to proceed with this change?

## User:


[text]  
please ensure that the Verbal Morphology section would have the correct cross references, those have not been applied I think


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, looking at the code blocks, I need to update the cross-references in the Verbal Morphology section. Here are the relevant line ranges for cross-references:

Here's the revised Verbal Morphology section with proper cross-references:

````markdown
## Verbal Morphology

### Verbalizer

- -'er ['er]: creates verbs from nouns and property concepts
  (See: [Proto-Hick](@/languages/hick/proto-hick.md#segmental-inventory))

1. Active verbs (from action/motion concepts):
   ```plaintext
   ai-es ter-'er
   water-ABS flow-VERB
   "Water flows"

   materok-el 'al-es ward-'er
   handler-ERG person-ABS guide-VERB
   "The handler guides the person"
   ```

   Examples:
   - ter-'er "to flow" (See: [Water Features](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/lexicon.md#water-features))
   - thren-'er "to watch" (See: [Sacred Terms](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/lexicon.md#sacred--ritual))
   - ward-'er "to guide"

2. Stative verbs (from property concepts):
   ```plaintext
   tor-thir-es thral-'er
   peak-KNOWN.ANIM-ABS sacred-VERB
   "The known peak is sacred"
   ```

   Examples:
   - thral-'er "to be sacred" (See: [Sacred Terms](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/lexicon.md#sacred--ritual))
   - mar-'er "to be red" (See: [Colors](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/lexicon.md#colors))

Note: Interpretation depends on base word semantics:
- Action/motion roots → active verbs (ter "flow", ward "guide")
- Property roots → stative verbs (thral "sacred")
(See: [Basic Terms](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/lexicon.md#basic-terms))

Would you like me to continue with the other sections of Verbal Morphology (Tense/Aspect, Spatial Reference)?

## User:


[text]  
should the Spatial Case System be in Verbal Morphology as well? then we similarly reference from Core Grammar the same way we did for Verbal System?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, looking at the content, the Spatial Case System should be part of Verbal Morphology since it's closely tied to verbal semantics and argument structure. Here are the relevant sections:

Core Grammar's Spatial Cases section:

```310:317:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
2. Spatial Cases (See: [Spatial Case System](#spatial-case-system))
   - Spatial cases mark the goal of the motion verb, supplanting the use of the
     ergative case in those contexts.
     - -aes (ILL): "inward, into"
     - -imris (ELL): "outward, from"
     - -itar (SUPE): "upward, upon"
     - -esp (SUB): "under, below"
     - -asam (SUBE): "downward, onto"
```


Current Spatial Case System section:

```336:355:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
### Spatial Case System
   - branum [bra.num] "past" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.INAN")
Early Hick's directional system marks the goal of the motion verb, supplanting
the use of the ergative case in those contexts.
       of time flowing from dawn to night
1. Basic Directionals
   - -aes: illative "inward, into"
   - -imris: ellative "outward, from"
   - -itar: superessive "upward, upon"
   - -asam: subessive "downward, onto"
   - -esp: sublative "under, below"
   - -sim: translative "change of state, become"
   - Examples:
     - keth-aes "into the sea"
     - keth-imris "from the sea"
     - tor-itar "upward to the peak"
     - tor-asam "downward from the peak"
2. Complex Directionals
   - -aes-imris: translative "change of state, become"
     - formal, reduced to shorter -sim
```


And the more detailed Directional System under Verbal Morphology:

````527:566:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
### Directional System
   - -tan [tan] "that" (animate)
1. Basic Directionals
   - -eth [eθ] "this/that" (inanimate)
   - -aes [aes] (ILL): "inward, into"
   - -imris [im.ris] (ELL): "outward, from"
   - -itar [i.tar] (SUPE): "upward, upon"
   - -esp [esp] (SUB): "under, below"
   - -asam [a.sam] (SUBE): "downward, onto"
2. Example Usage
2. Example Usage
   - materokel rismateraes "the boatman enters the reed boat"
   ```plaintext
   materok-el rismater-aes
   handler-ERG reed.boat-ILL
   "The handler enters the reed boat"
3. Notes:
   materok-el rismater-imris
   handler-ERG reed.boat-ELL
   "The handler exits the reed boat"
     directionals
   materok-el rismater-itar
   handler-ERG reed.boat-SUPE
   "The handler climbs onto the reed boat"
Early Hick has no true adjective class. Quality concepts are expressed through:
   materok-el rismater-asam
   handler-ERG reed.boat-SUBE
   "The handler climbs down from the reed boat"
   ```
   - Takes absolutive argument Examples:
3. Syntactic Properties
   - Directional cases imply motion verbs
   - Ergative (-el) marks the agent
   - No additional case marking needed on the goal/source
   - Can be fronted for emphasis:
     ```plaintext
     keth-aes materok-el rismater-es
     sea-ILL  handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS
     "To sea the handler (takes) the reed boat"
     ```plaintext
````


I suggest:
1. Moving all spatial/directional content to the Verbal Morphology section
2. Updating the Core Grammar section to reference it like we did with the Verbal System:

```markdown
### Spatial Case System

See: [Verbal Morphology](#verbal-morphology) for details on:
- Basic directionals (-aes, -imris, etc.)
- Complex directionals
- Interaction with verbal semantics
- Syntactic properties
```

Would you like me to show the consolidated Verbal Morphology section with the spatial/directional content integrated?

## User:


[text]  
Perhaps we make the header of that section be "Spatial Case System" instead of simply Directional System. Directional might be a subsection to that though.

the latives have actually expanded from just marking directionality at this point. they also indicate  Change of State as well. I also eventually plan to have some Causative constructions using these spatial cases


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, you're right. Looking at the code blocks, I see that the spatial cases have broader functions beyond just direction. Let me propose a reorganized structure for the Spatial Case System section under Verbal Morphology:

```markdown
### Spatial Case System

Early Hick's spatial case system interacts closely with verbal semantics, marking 
not only physical direction but also abstract state changes and causation.

1. Basic Spatial Cases
   - -aes (ILL): "inward, into"
   - -imris (ELL): "outward, from"
   - -itar (SUPE): "upward, upon"
   - -asam (SUBE): "downward, onto"
   - -esp (SUB): "under, below"

2. Directional Usage
   ```plaintext
   materok-el rismater-aes
   handler-ERG reed.boat-ILL
   "The handler enters the reed boat"

   keth-aes materok-el rismater-es
   sea-ILL  handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS
   "To sea the handler (takes) the reed boat"
   ```

3. Change of State
   ```plaintext
   kamar kel-es kakel-aes
   red sky-ABS blue-ILL
   "red sky turns blue"
   ```

4. Syntactic Properties
   - Supplants ergative case in motion contexts
   - Can be fronted for emphasis
   - Implies motion/change without overt verb
   - Interacts with causative constructions
```

This reorganization:
1. References lines 587-603 for Change of State usage
2. References lines 557-566 for syntactic properties
3. Sets up structure for future causative constructions
4. Maintains connection to Core Grammar reference (lines 310-317)

Would you like me to continue with the other subsections?

## User:


[text]  
let's reference the Adjectival System to the Change of State feature in this section. That way we would have a separate, more indepth section for adjectival, but is referenced here as it does act on the verb


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, good idea. Looking at the code blocks, I see the relevant sections are:


````599:640:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Adjectival Morphology
- ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)
Early Hick has no true adjective class. Quality concepts are expressed through:
### Negation System
1. Stativ
- mo- [mo]: general negation prefix Examples:
   - Uses verbalizer -ʔer
   - Takes absolutive argument Examples:
- mo-ward "misdirect, lead astray"
     ```plaintext
   kel-es kakel-ʔer
   sky-ABS blue-VERB
   "The sky is blue"
- Sound changes:
   thral-el kel-es kakel-ʔer
   ritual-ERG sky-ABS blue-VERB
   "The ritual makes the sky blue"
   ```plaintext
- thral-kel → thrakel "sun" (sacred-sky)
2. Change of State
### Body Metaphors
   1. Translative (-sim):
1. Breath as the soul
      ```plaintext
      kel-es kakel-sim
      sky.ABS blue.TRANS  
      "sky becomes blue"  
      ```
7. Skin as appearance
   2. Directional Cases (-aes/-imris):
## Affix Order
      ```plaintext
      kamar kel-es kakel-aes
      red sky-ABS blue-ILL
      "red sky turns blue"
      ```
   - (PREFIX*) + ROOT + (SUFFIX*)
3. Notes:
   - No attributive modification
   - All qualities are verbal predicates
   - Follows ergative-absolutive alignment
   - Causatives marked by adding ergative agent

## User:


[text]  
yes please


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the code blocks, I'll organize the Verbal Morphology section. Here's my proposed structure, referencing the relevant line ranges:

````markdown
## Verbal Morphology

### Verbalizer
[Lines 433-481 contain the current verbalizer section, which looks good]

### Tense and Aspect Marking

1. Basic Temporal Markers
   ```plaintext
   branum materok-el ward-'er
   past   handler-ERG guide-VERB
   "The handler guided (in the past)"
   ```

   - branum [bra.num] "past" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.INAN")
     - From bran "dawn" + -um "distal inanimate"
     - Used for general past reference and narratives
   
   - branrum [bran.rum] "ancestral time" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.ANIM")
     - Uses animate distal marker for sacred histories
     - Contrasts with branum by marking time as animate/sacred

   - mulsum [mul.sum] "future" (lit. "night-change-DIST")
     - From mulsimrum "changes to a distant night"
     - Used for predictions and intentions

2. Position and Usage (See: [Syntax](#clause-structure-and-word-order))
   - Initial: sets temporal frame
   - Pre-verbal: marks temporal contrast
   - Final: neutral narrative position

### Case System Interaction

1. Active Verbs:
   ```plaintext
   materok-el kethmater-im-ris keth-es ward-ter
   boatman-ERG sea.vessel-PROX-ELL sea-ABS direct-to
   "The boatman takes the sea vessel to the ocean"
   ```

2. Stative Verbs:
   ```plaintext
   mal-thir-es thral-'er
   pool-KNOWN.ANIM-ABS sacred-VERB
   "The known pool is sacred"
   ```

### Spatial Case System
[Lines 527-576 contain the current spatial case section, which looks good]
````

This organization:
1. References lines 484-502 for temporal markers
2. References lines 732-775 for position and usage
3. References lines 506-525 for case interaction
4. Maintains the existing spatial case section

Would you like me to continue with any other sections or make adjustments to this structure?

## User:


[text]  
would tense and aspect marking actually be better in the Syntax section entirely? they don't actually alter the verb. we do need actual examples of the tense and aspects we have. we seem to have lost those


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, you're right. Looking at the code blocks, I see that tense/aspect marking is more syntactic in nature. The relevant sections are:


````729:780:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
1. Basic Patterns
     - ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)
   - Core arguments marked by case, allowing flexible word order
   - Ergative (-el) marks agent of transitive verbs
   - Absolutive (-es) marks patient of transitive & sole argument of
     intransitive
   - Word order signals pragmatic functions rather than grammatical roles
   - Water Movement: kəran "stream-like", kəthrim "wave-like"
2. Information Structure
   - Sounds: kəmer "bird-like (sound)", kəsak "wolf-like (howl)"
   - Initial position: topic/focus or temporal frame
   - Final position: new information or emphasis
   - Examples:
1. Visible/Known
      ```plaintext
     branum bramisimris kethes
     past    river-ELL    sea-ABS
     "In the past, the river flowed to the sea" (temporal frame first)
2. Hidden but Sensed
     kethes bramisimris branum
     sea-ABS river-ELL    past
     "The river flowed to the sea, in the past" (neutral statement)
     ```
   - -rum [rum] "that" (animate)
3. Verb Position and Aspect
### Personal Reference
   - Verbs can occur in different positions based on aspect:
1. Spatial Demonstratives
     ```plaintext
     materok-el rismater-es ward tel
     handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide COMPL
     "The handler has guided the reed boat" (completed action)
### Negation System
     rismater-es ward kethes
     reed.boat-ABS guide sea-ABS
     "The reed boat guides to sea" (general statement)
      ```
     - mo-ter "not flowing, stagnant"
   - Directional constructions allow goal prominence:
     ```plaintext
     keth-aes materok-el rismater-es
     sea-ILL  handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS
     "To sea the handler (takes) the reed boat"
     ```
   - mater-ok "vessel owner"
4. Temporal Reference
   - istel-ʔal "this.place-person" (speaker's location)
   - Time words can float freely but tend toward:
     - Initial: setting temporal frame for discourse
     - Pre-verbal: marking temporal contrast
     - Final: neutral narrative position
- -ʔer [ʔer]: creates active verbs Examples:
````

   - branrum [bran.rum] "ancestral time" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.ANIM")
     - Sacred histories and ancestral stories
   - Position affects meaning:
     ```plaintext

     past   river-ELL    sea-ABS
     "In the past, the river flowed to the sea" (temporal frame)

     bramisimris branum kethes
     river-ELL   past   sea-ABS
     "The river USED TO flow to the sea" (emphasis)
     ```

2. Future Reference
   ```plaintext
   mulsum materok-el ward-'er
   future handler-ERG guide-VERB
   "The handler will guide"
   ```
   - mulsum [mul.sum] "future" (lit. "night-change-DIST")
     - Used for both predictions and intentions

3. Completive Aspect
   ```plaintext
   materok-el rismater-es ward tel
   handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide COMPL
   "The handler has guided the reed boat"
   ```
   - tel [tel] "complete, finished"
   - Always follows main clause
````

This better reflects that tense/aspect are syntactic constructions rather than verbal morphology. Would you like me to adjust the Verbal Morphology section accordingly?

## User:


[text]  
yes please. also, if this is considered Core Grammar, perhaps we also want a reference to it


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, looking at the structure, we should:

1. Move Tense/Aspect to Syntax (lines 729-780)
2. Add a reference in Core Grammar (around lines 328-336)
3. Keep only morphological aspects in Verbal Morphology (lines 431-581)

Here's my proposed reorganization:

In Core Grammar, add:

```markdown
### Temporal System

See: [Clause Structure and Word Order](#clause-structure-and-word-order) for details on:
- Basic temporal markers (branum, branrum, mulsum)
- Position and usage
- Interaction with aspect
- Temporal reference in discourse
```

The Verbal Morphology section should focus on:

````431:481:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Verbal Morphology
Early Hick's directional system marks the goal of the motion verb, supplanting
### Verbalizer
   - ter-ʔer "to flow" (flow-ACT)
- -'er ['er]: creates verbs from nouns and property concepts (See:
  [Proto-Hick](@/languages/hick/proto-hick.md#segmental-inventory))
1. Diminutive (li-)
1. Active verbs (from action/motion concepts):
   - Prefix meaning "small, lesser"
   ```plaintext
   ai-es ter-'er
   water-ABS flow-VERB
   "Water flows"
     - keth-imris "from the sea"
   materok-el 'al-es ward-'er
   handler-ERG person-ABS guide-VERB
   "The handler guides the person"
   ```
     - topel [to.pel] "great bear" (tor-pel → topel, liquid deletion)
   Examples:
3. Speed Augmentative (tor- -sim)
   - ter-'er "to flow" (See:
     [Water Features](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/lexicon.md#water-features))
   - thren-'er "to watch" (See:

   - Body Parts: kəbel "mouth-like", kəven "wing-like"
Note: Interpretation depends on base word semantics:
   - Water Movement: kəran "stream-like", kəthrim "wave-like"
- Action/motion roots → active verbs (ter "flow", ward "guide")
- Property roots → stative verbs (thral "sacred") (See:

(Verbalizer section)


````509:530:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
### Case System Interaction
3. Distant/Out of Sight
1. Active Verbs:
   - -rum [rum] "that" (animate)
   - Take ergative agent and absolutive patient
   - Example:
   - mater-ok "vessel owner"
     ```
     materok-el kethmater-im-ris keth-es ward-ter
     boatman-ERG sea.vessel-PROX-ELL sea-ABS direct-to
     "The boatman takes the sea vessel to the ocean"

### Spatial Case System
   - -itar: superlative "upward"
Early Hick's spatial case system interacts closely with verbal semantics,
marking not only physical direction but also abstract state changes and
causation.
### Possession Marking
1. Basic Spatial Cases
   - materokel rismaterimris "the boatman exits the reed boat"
   - -aes (ILL): "inward, into"
   - -imris (ELL): "outward, from"
   - -itar (SUPE): "upward, upon"
   - -asam (SUBE): "downward, onto"
   - -esp (SUB): "under, below"
   - Ergative (-el) marks the agent
2. Directional Usage
     directionals
   ```plaintext
   materok-el rismater-aes
   handler-ERG reed.boat-ILL
   "The handler enters the reed boat"
   - -asam: sublative "downward"
   materok-el rismater-imris
   handler-ERG reed.boat-ELL
   "Th
   - Takes absolutive argument Examples:
   materok-el rismater-itar
   handler-ERG reed.boat-SUPE
   "The handler climbs onto the reed boat"
   - -asam: sublative "downward"
   materok-el rismater-asam
   handler-ERG reed.boat-SUBE
   "The handler climbs down from the reed boat"
     ```plaintext

3. Change of State
      (general change of state)
   - Spatial cases extend to mark state changes
   - See: [Adjectival System](#adjectival-morphology) for full details
      ritual.ERG blue.TRANS  
     ```plaintext
   kamar kel-es kakel-aes
   red sky-ABS blue-ILL
   "red sky turns blue"
     ```plaintext
      kamar keles kakelaes  
4. Syntactic Properties
   - Supplants ergative case in motion contexts
   - Can be fronted for emphasis
   - Implies motion/change without overt verb
   - Interacts with causative constructions

And move the Tense/Aspect content to Syntax, expanding it as part of:

````753:779:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
3. Verb Position and Aspect
### Personal Reference
   - Verbs can occur in different positions based on aspect:
1. Spatial Demonstratives
     ```plaintext
     materok-el rismater-es ward tel
     handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide COMPL
     "The handler has guided the reed boat" (completed action)
### Negation System
     rismater-es ward kethes
     reed.boat-ABS guide sea-ABS
     "The reed boat guides to sea" (general statement)
      ```
     - mo-ter "not flowing, stagnant"
   - Directional constructions allow goal prominence:
     ```plaintext
     keth-aes materok-el rismater-es
     sea-ILL  handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS
     "To sea the handler (takes) the reed boat"
     ```
   - mater-ok "vessel owner"
4. Temporal Reference
   - istel-ʔal "this.place-person" (speaker's location)
   - Time words can float freely but tend toward:
     - Initial: setting temporal frame for discourse
     - Pre-verbal: marking temporal contrast
     - Final: neutral narrative position
````


Would you like me to show the complete reorganized sections?

## User:


[text]  
yes please


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Based on the code blocks, here's how I would reorganize the sections:

1. In Core Grammar, add a new Temporal System reference:

```markdown
### Temporal System

See: [Clause Structure and Word Order](#clause-structure-and-word-order) for details on:
- Basic temporal markers (branum, branrum, mulsum)
- Position and usage
- Interaction with aspect
- Temporal reference in discourse
```

2. Keep Verbal Morphology focused on morphological aspects:

```markdown
## Verbal Morphology

### Verbalizer

- -'er ['er]: creates verbs from nouns and property concepts
  (See: [Proto-Hick](@/languages/hick/proto-hick.md#segmental-inventory))

1. Active verbs (from action/motion concepts):
   ```plaintext
   ai-es ter-'er
   water-ABS flow-VERB
   "Water flows"
   ```

2. Stative verbs (from property concepts):
   ```plaintext
   tor-thir-es thral-'er
   peak-KNOWN.ANIM-ABS sacred-VERB
   "The known peak is sacred"
   ```

### Case System Interaction

1. Active Verbs:
   ```plaintext
   materok-el kethmater-im-ris keth-es ward-ter
   boatman-ERG sea.vessel-PROX-ELL sea-ABS direct-to
   "The boatman takes the sea vessel to the ocean"
   ```

2. Stative Verbs:
   ```plaintext
   mal-thir-es thral-'er
   pool-KNOWN.ANIM-ABS sacred-VERB
   "The known pool is sacred"
   ```

### Spatial Case System
[Content as previously discussed]

# Syntax
   - Plant Growth: kəthir "grass-like", kəbel "vine-like"
## Clause Structure and Word Order
### Number Marking
1. Basic Patterns
1. Plural Prefix (ma-)
   - Core arguments marked by case, allowing flexible word order
   - Ergative (-el) marks agent of transitive verbs
   - Absolutive (-es) marks patient of transitive & sole argument of
     intransitive
   - Word order signals pragmatic functions rather than grammatical roles
2. Hidden but Sensed
2. Information Structure
   - -thir [θir] "this/that" (animate)
   - Initial position: topic/focus or temporal frame
   - Final position: new information or emphasis
   - Examples:
   - Weather: kəbran "storm-like", kəthral "mist-like"
     ```plaintext
     branum bramisimris kethes
     past    river-ELL    sea-ABS
     "In the past, the river flowed to the sea" (temporal frame first)

     kethes bramisimris branum
     sea-ABS river-ELL    past
     "The river flowed to the sea, in the past" (neutral statement)

1. Basic Negation
3. Verb Position and Aspect

Would you like me to continue with the detailed organization of the Syntax section?

## User:


[text]  
sure. let's check if there are features mislabeled in other sections that ought to be syntactic instead of morphological


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking through the code blocks, I notice several features currently labeled as morphological that appear to be more syntactic in nature. Here are the sections that should be moved/reorganized:

1. From Verbal Morphology (lines 442-491), the tense/aspect content should move to Syntax

2. From Core Grammar (lines 290-355), the Temporal System reference is correctly placed, but we should add more cross-references to Syntax

3. From Spatial Case System (lines 494-543), some syntactic properties should move:

```539:543:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - materokel rismaterimris "the boatman exits the reed boat"
   - materokel rismateritar "the boatman climbs onto the reed boat"
   - materokel rismaterasam "the boatman climbs down from the reed boat"
- thral-ʔer "to be sacred" (sacred-ACT)
3. Notes:
```


4. From Adjectival Morphology (lines 545-586), these syntactic properties should move:

```582:586:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
      blue sky.ABS red.ELL  
      "blue sky turns back red"  
      (return to state)
      (general change of state)
3. Notes:
```


5. From Clause Structure and Word Order (lines 691-741), this is correctly placed but should be expanded with the moved content

I suggest reorganizing the Syntax section to include:

1. Basic Clause Structure
2. Information Structure
3. Tense and Aspect System
   - Temporal markers
   - Position effects
   - Aspect marking
4. Adjectival Syntax
   - Predicate structure
   - Causative constructions
5. Spatial Syntax
   - Goal prominence
   - Case interactions
   - Motion implications

Would you like me to show the detailed reorganization of any of these sections?

## User:


[text]  
we already moved the tense and aspect markings right?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, looking at the code blocks, we already moved the tense and aspect content to the Syntax section. However, I notice there's still a duplicate "Tense and Aspect" section (lines 757-804) that should be merged with the earlier content in "Clause Structure and Word Order" (lines 734-755).

We should consolidate these into a single section under Syntax, combining:


````734:755:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - Body Parts: kəbel "mouth-like", kəven "wing-like"
4. Temporal Reference
   - Water Movement: kəran "stream-like", kəthrim "wave-like"
   - Time words can float freely but tend toward:
     - Initial: setting temporal frame for discourse
     - Pre-verbal: marking temporal contrast
     - Final: neutral narrative position
   - Examples:
1. Visible/Known
      ```plaintext

Would you like me to show how to merge these sections while removing the duplication?

## User:


[text]  
I think it should be referenced instead of outright removed


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, you're right. Looking at the code blocks, we should:

1. Keep the detailed Tense and Aspect section (lines 757-804) as its own section in Syntax

2. Add a reference in Clause Structure and Word Order (around line 714) that points to the full section:

```markdown
3. Verb Position and Aspect
   - Verbs can occur in different positions based on aspect
   - See: [Tense and Aspect](#tense-and-aspect) for full details
   ```plaintext
   materok-el rismater-es ward tel
   handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide COMPL
   "The handler has guided the reed boat" (completed action)
   ```
```

3. Add a reference in Core Grammar (around line 289) to both sections:

```markdown
### Temporal System

See: [Clause Structure and Word Order](#clause-structure-and-word-order) and 
[Tense and Aspect](#tense-and-aspect) for details on:
- Basic temporal markers
- Position and usage
- Aspect marking
- Temporal reference in discourse
```

This maintains the detailed information while providing clear cross-references. Would you like me to show the complete reorganization of any of these sections?

## User:


[text]  
let's not remove any of that content. it still makes sense to have some examples that describe how it works in the context of clause construction, then we have a cross-reference to the larger article on tense and aspect


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

You're right. Looking at the code blocks, we should:

1. Keep the Verb Position and Aspect examples in Clause Structure (lines 714-733) as they demonstrate basic word order patterns

2. Keep the Temporal Reference section in Clause Structure (lines 735-755) as it shows position-based meaning differences

3. Keep the full Tense and Aspect section (lines 757-804) for detailed temporal/aspectual information

4. Add a cross-reference in the Clause Structure section after the examples, something like:

```markdown
   See: [Tense and Aspect](#tense-and-aspect) for a complete description of:
   - Past reference markers (branum, branrum)
   - Future reference (mulsum)
   - Completive aspect (tel)
   - Position effects on temporal interpretation
```

This maintains the natural flow from basic clause structure to temporal positioning, while pointing readers to the detailed section for full coverage.

Would you like me to show the specific changes to either section?

## User:


[text]  
I modified the structure of the doc by moving the Core Grammar section out of Morphology, so we can use it as a kind of cross-reference section for common language features to their actual appropriate sections, whether they are morphological in nature or syntactic.


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, that's a good approach. Looking at the code blocks, I see the Core Grammar section (lines 286-344) serves as a high-level overview with cross-references to detailed sections.

The key sections that should be referenced from Core Grammar are:


````288:344:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
relations are marked through suffixes, while derivational processes primarily
## Core Grammar

### Case System

1. Primary Cases

   - -el [el] (ERG): marks agent of transitive verbs
   - -es [es] (ABS): marks patient of transitive & sole argument of intransitive
   - -el [el] (ERG): marks agent of transitive verbs
   Examples:

   ```plaintext
   materok-el ʔal-es ward-ter
   handler-ERG person-ABS direct-to
   "The handler directs the person"
   handler-ERG person-ABS direct-to
   ʔal-es ter-ʔer
   person-ABS move-ACT
   "The person moves"
   ```
   "The person moves"
2. Spatial Cases (See: [Spatial Case System](#spatial-case-system))
   - Spatial cases mark the goal of the motion verb, supplanting the use of the
     ergative case in those contexts.
     - -aes (ILL): "inward, into"
     - -imris (ELL): "outward, from"
     - -itar (SUPE): "upward, upon"
     - -esp (SUB): "under, below"
     - -asam (SUBE): "downward, onto"
     - -esp (SUB): "under, below"
### Agentive Marking

1. Primary Marker
   - -ok [ok]: agentive nominalizer (forms agent nouns, both occupational and
     active) Examples:
   - materok "boatman" < mater-ok "vessel-AGENT" (one who works with vessels)
   - wardok "guide" < ward-ok "direct-AGENT" (one who directs)
   - threnok "watcher" < thren-ok "watch-AGENT" (one who watches)
   - wardok "guide" < ward-ok "direct-AGENT" (one who directs)
[Note: The -er suffix appears in Middle Hick through Old Iutlandish
contact, leading to the occupational/active distinction between -ok/-er in Late Hick]
[Note: The -er suffix appears in Middle Hick through Old Iutlandish
### Verbal System
- Tense and aspect marking
1. Verbalizer
   - -ʔer [ʔer]: creates active verbs
   Examples:
   - ter-ʔer "to flow" (flow-ACT)
   - thral-ʔer "to be sacred" (sacred-ACT)
   - thren-ʔer "to watch" (watch-ACT)
     water-ABS flow-VERB
2. Example Clauses:
   ```plaintext
   materok-el rismater-es ward
   boatman-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide
   "The boatman guides the reed boat"
````


This includes references to:
1. Case System (detailed in Morphology)
2. Verbal System (split between Morphology and Syntax)
3. Spatial Case System (detailed in Morphology)
4. Temporal System (detailed in Syntax)

The Temporal System reference is particularly well structured as it points to the relevant sections in Syntax:


````334:342:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - -ʔer [ʔer]: creates active verbs
   Examples:
   - ter-ʔer "to flow" (flow-ACT)
   - thral-ʔer "to be sacred" (sacred-ACT)
   - thren-ʔer "to watch" (watch-ACT)
     water-ABS flow-VERB
2. Example Clauses:
   ```plaintext
   materok-el rismater-es ward
````


Would you like me to propose a similar reference structure for the other Core Grammar sections?

## User:


[text]  
not currently. I was wondering if the Personal Reference Section should also be in Syntax instead? they would be used 

thren'er istel'alel
watch-VERB 1SG.PROX.person
this person is watching


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, looking at the Personal Reference section (lines 418-423), it should be moved to Syntax since it deals with how spatial demonstratives are used to form personal reference in clauses.


```418:423:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - ishis [is.his] "and then"
   - ethis [eθ.is] "while"
   - umis [um.is] "or else"
   - is "and" (sequential)
### Verbal System
   - um "or"
```


This section shows how spatial demonstratives combine with -'al to create person references, which is more syntactic than morphological in nature. The example you provided demonstrates its syntactic usage perfectly.

We should:

1. Move the Personal Reference section to Syntax, after Clause Structure (around line 756)
2. Keep a cross-reference in the Demonstrative System section (around line 404)
3. Add examples showing clause construction with personal reference

Would you like me to show the reorganized sections?

## User:


[text]  
I suppose the addition of 'al is still morphological in nature, but yes the usage is syntactic, especially as it relates to referent tracking. 

I think we're missing sections regarding conjugation... I think we lost it in the changes...


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

You're right. Looking at the code blocks, we're missing conjugation patterns. The current Verbal Morphology section (lines 440-491) only covers the verbalizer -'er, but doesn't describe how verbs conjugate.

From the examples scattered throughout the text, we can see conjugation patterns in:


```717:725:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
     - limal [li.mal] "small pool, pond"
