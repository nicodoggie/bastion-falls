We should develop terminology for truth and falsehood in @early-hick . what are typical roots/derivations for these concepts IRL?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Let me help develop terminology for truth/falsehood in Early Hick. First, let's analyze how truth/falsehood concepts typically develop in natural languages:

Common etymological sources for "truth" concepts:
1. "That which is firm/solid/stable"
- Sanskrit "satya" from "sat" (being, existing)
- PIE *es- "to be"
- Hebrew "emet" from root meaning "firmness, reliability"

2. "That which is seen/clear"
- Greek "aletheia" (un-hidden, un-concealed)
- Latin "verus" possibly from *weh₁- "see, know"

3. "That which is straight/direct"
- PIE *reǵ- "straight, right" → "right, correct"
- Latin "rectus" → "right, correct"

For Early Hick, looking at the existing lexicon and patterns:


```161:163:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Kinship Terms
```


We see "thren" meaning "watch, observe (ritual)" - this could be a good root for truth concepts, following the "that which is seen/clear" pattern.


```511:517:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Kinship Terms
```


We also see "lis" meaning "eye/perceive" with interesting semantic development.

Proposed Early Hick truth/falsehood terminology:

1. Truth concepts:
- threnlis [θren.lis] "truth" < thren-lis "watch-eye" → "that which is observed/seen"
- threner [θre.ner] "true" (stative verb) < thren-er "watch-ACT" → "to be observed/seen"
- threnok [θre.nok] "truth-teller" < thren-ok "watch-AGENT"

2. Falsehood concepts:

```641:643:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
1. Outer Prefixes (first position)
   - mo- (NEG): negation
   - ma- (PL): plural
```


Using the negation prefix mo-:
- mothren [mo.θren] "unseen, false" < mo-thren "NEG-watch"
- mothrenlis [mo.θren.lis] "falsehood" < mo-thren-lis "NEG-watch-eye"
- mothrenok [mo.θre.nok] "liar" < mo-thren-ok "NEG-watch-AGENT"

This system:
1. Builds on existing roots related to observation/perception
2. Uses established morphological patterns
3. Follows cross-linguistic patterns for truth/falsehood derivation
4. Fits Early Hick's cultural emphasis on observation/ritual watching
5. Creates a symmetrical system using the negation prefix

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or explore additional related terminology?

[text]  
in languages with evidentials. do they have specific terms still? or would they be based on markings?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the Early Hick documentation, I notice it already has a strong 
connection between truth/observation and the root "thren" (watch/observe):


```161:162:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
     See: [Time Terms](#time--celestial)
   - thren [θren] "watch, observe (ritual)" < Proto-Hick \*threnu → thren
```


Languages with evidential systems typically handle truth/falsehood through their 
grammatical markings rather than lexical items, but they often still have terms for:

1. Truth as conformity with reality
2. Truth as sincerity/honesty
3. Falsehood as deception/lies

For Early Hick, I'd suggest:

1. Direct Evidence Terms (based on thren-):
- threnlis [θren.lis] "truth" (watch-eye, directly observed truth)
- threnok [θre.nok] "witness" (watch-AGENT, one who has seen)
- thren'er [θre.ner] "to witness/observe" (watch-ACT)

2. Reported Evidence Terms (new root ward- "guide/direct"):
- wardlis [ward.lis] "reported truth" (guide-eye, guided/directed knowledge)
- wardok [war.dok] "truth-teller" (guide-AGENT)
- ward'er [war.der] "to tell/report" (guide-ACT)

3. Inferred Evidence (using ka- similarity prefix):

```465:468:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

1. Similarity Prefix (ka-)
   - Prefix meaning "like, similar to"
   - Always surfaces as [kə-] due to regular vowel reduction
```


- kathren [kə.θren] "seems true" (like-watch)
- kathrenlis [kə.θren.lis] "inferred truth" (like-watch-eye)

4. False/Deceptive (using mo- negation):

```504:508:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

1. Basic Negation
   - mo- [mo]: general negation prefix Examples:
     - mo-thral "non-sacred, profane"
     - mo-ter "not flowing, stagnant"
```


- mothren [mo.θren] "false" (not-watch)
- mothrenok [mo.θre.nok] "liar" (not-watch-AGENT)
- moward [mo.ward] "mislead" (not-guide)

This system:
1. Builds on existing morphology
2. Maintains the language's focus on direct observation
3. Creates a three-way evidential distinction (direct/reported/inferred)
4. Uses established prefixes for negation/similarity
5. Follows the language's compound formation patterns

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this system?

## User:


[text]  
in the early hick lexicon, we have examples of an existing use of 'ward' but it isn't properly documented. can you check what the existing usage is and see if it fits your new terms?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Let me check the existing uses of 'ward' in the lexicon. I found these references:


````302:304:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   ```plaintext
   materok-el ʔal-es ward-ter
   handler-ERG person-ABS direct-to
````

Here we see "ward-ter" meaning "direct-to" in an example sentence.


```505:508:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
1. Basic Negation
   - mo- [mo]: general negation prefix Examples:
     - mo-thral "non-sacred, profane"
     - mo-ter "not flowing, stagnant"
```

And here we see "mo-ward" meaning "misdirect, lead astray" in the negation examples.


```325:327:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
     active) Examples:
   - materok "boatman" < mater-ok "vessel-AGENT" (one who works with vessels)
   - wardok "guide" < ward-ok "direct-AGENT" (one who directs)
```

We also see "wardok" meaning "guide" derived from "ward-ok" (direct-AGENT).

This shows that 'ward' has an existing meaning of "direct/guide" in Early Hick, which 
actually fits perfectly with my earlier suggestion for truth terms! The semantic 
connection between "guiding/directing" and "telling truth" is cross-linguistically 
common.

I would revise my earlier proposal to better align with this established meaning:

1. Direct Evidence (thren- based):
- threnlis "truth" (watch-eye, directly observed truth)
- threnok "witness" (watch-AGENT)

2. Reported Truth (ward- based):
- wardlis "reported truth" (guide-eye, guided knowledge) 
- wardok "truth-teller/guide" (guide-AGENT) - this already exists!
- ward'er "to tell truth/guide" (guide-ACT)

3. False/Deceptive:
- moward "mislead" (NEG-guide) - this already exists!
- mowardok "liar" (NEG-guide-AGENT)

This system builds directly on the established meaning of 'ward' as "direct/guide" 
while maintaining the metaphorical extension to truth-telling that's common across 
languages.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this revised system?

## User:


[text]  
let's document the root in the lexicon first, including our ontolex-lemon document in @lexicon.jsonld 


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the lexicon data, I'll help document the 'ward' root in the lexicon format. 
First, let's check the existing usage in the markdown:


```324:326:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - materok "boatman" < mater-ok "vessel-AGENT" (one who works with vessels)
   - wardok "guide" < ward-ok "direct-AGENT" (one who directs)
   - threnok "watcher" < thren-ok "watch-AGENT" (one who watches)
```


This shows 'wardok' as "guide" from ward-ok "direct-AGENT".

Here's the proposed ontolex-lemon entry for the lexicon.jsonld:

```json
{
  "@id": "eh:ward",
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
  "canonicalForm": {
    "@type": "ontolex:Form",
    "writtenRep": "ward",
    "phoneticRep": "ward"
  },
  "lexicalCategory": "lexinfo:Verb",
  "etymology": {
    "@type": "etymon:Etymology",
    "etymon:protoform": "Proto-Hick *wardu",
    "etymon:soundChange": "final vowel loss"
  },
  "sense": [
    {
      "@type": "ontolex:LexicalSense",
      "definition": {
        "@value": "direct, guide",
        "@language": "en"
      },
      "usage": "Used for both physical and metaphorical guidance",
      "lexinfo:semanticField": [
        "Basic Terms",

      "definition": {
        "@value": "tell truth, instruct correctly",
        "@language": "en"
      },
      "usage": "Extended meaning for truthful instruction/guidance",

        "Sacred & Ritual"
      ],
      "lexinfo:register": "lexinfo:formalRegister"
    }
  ]
}
```

And we should add related compound entries:

```json
{
  "@id": "eh:wardok",
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
  "canonicalForm": {
    "@type": "ontolex:Form",

    "@type": "etymon:Etymology",
    "etymon:compound": "ward-ok",

  },
  "sense": [
    {

        "@language": "en"
      },
      "usage": "One who guides or tells truth",
      "lexinfo:semanticField": [
        "Occupations",
        "Sacred & Ritual"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This documentation:
1. Establishes the basic meaning "direct/guide"
2. Shows the semantic extension to truth-telling
3. Links to the existing agentive form
4. Follows the established ontolex-lemon format
5. Includes proper etymological information

Would you like me to add any additional compounds or elaborate on any aspect?

[text]  
let's start with just ward. we also want to update the markdown lexicon separately


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the lexicon, I see 'wad' (path, way) documented but not 'ward'. Let's add 
'ward' properly to the lexicon. From the grammar examples, we can see it's used in:


```504:507:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - mo- [mo]: general negation prefix Examples:
     - mo-thral "non-sacred, profane"
     - mo-ter "not flowing, stagnant"
     - mo-ward "misdirect, lead astray"
```


And:


```324:326:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - materok "boatman" < mater-ok "vessel-AGENT" (one who works with vessels)
   - wardok "guide" < ward-ok "direct-AGENT" (one who directs)
   - threnok "watcher" < thren-ok "watch-AGENT" (one who watches)
```


Here's the proposed lexicon entry for 'ward' in the markdown format:

```markdown
- ward [ward] "direct, guide" < Proto-Hick *wardu → ward
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  See: [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual), [Maritime Terms](#maritime-terms)
  Note: Used for both physical guidance and metaphorical direction/instruction
```

This should be added to the Basic Terms section of the lexicon, near:


```156:164:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
1. Basic Terms
   - thral [θral] "sacred, ritual; day" < Proto-Hick \*thralu → thral
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
     See: [Time Terms](#time--celestial)
   - thren [θren] "watch, observe (ritual)" < Proto-Hick \*threnu → thren
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - wad [wad] "path, way" < Proto-Hick \*wadu → wad
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
     See: [Maritime Terms](#maritime-terms)
```


The entry:
1. Shows the phonetic form
2. Gives the basic meaning
3. Provides the Proto-Hick etymology
4. References the sound change rule
5. Cross-references relevant semantic fields
6. Adds usage note about physical/metaphorical meanings
7. Places it with other basic terms

Would you like me to proceed with the ontolex-lemon entry next?

## User:


[text]  
this basic terms section seems to be under the heading of Sacred & Ritual though. so I moved it to the actual basic terms section with haran, Also, I notice that you add Maritime Terms as a cross-refenence, but the Maritime Terms are under the Material Culture header


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

You're right on both counts. Looking at the structure:



```24:29:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Basic Terms
### Basic Terms
- haran [ha.ran] "split, divide" < Proto-Hick \*haranu → haran
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  See: [Number System](#number-system),
  [Compound Formation](#compound-formation)
```


Shows the Basic Terms section where 'ward' should go, with 'haran'.



```203:211:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
2. Maritime Terms
   - mater [ma.ter] "vessel" < mal-ter "pool-flow" → mater
     ([liquid deletion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#late-hickearly-seneran-105-ai-to-400-ai))
   - materok [ma.te.rok] "vessel-guide, boatman" < mater-ok "vessel-AGENT" →
     materok
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
     See: [Agentive Suffix](#agentive-suffix)
   - rismater [ris.ma.ter] "reed-vessel" < ris-mater "reed-vessel" → rismater
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
```


Shows the Maritime Terms under Material Culture.

Let's revise the entry to be in Basic Terms and update the cross-references:

```markdown
- ward [ward] "direct, guide" < Proto-Hick *wardu → ward
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  See: [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual)
  Note: Used for both physical guidance and metaphorical direction/instruction
```

This places it with other basic vocabulary and removes the incorrect Maritime Terms 
reference. Would you like me to proceed with the ontolex-lemon entry next?

## User:


[text]  
yes please


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the lexicon data, I'll create the ontolex-lemon entry for 'ward'. We can see its usage in:


```664:665:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
2. mal-thir-el ai-es ward-ter  
   pool-KNOWN.ANIM-ERG water-ABS contain-to  
```

showing "ward-ter" meaning "contain/direct-to", and:


```503:507:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
1. Basic Terms
   - ma'al [ma.ʔal] "community, tribe" < ma-'al "COLL-person" → ma'al
     See: [Person Terms](#person-terms)
     ([vowel coalescence](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
### Kinship Terms
```

showing "mo-ward" meaning "misdirect, lead astray".

Here's the ontolex-lemon entry:

```json

  "related": [
    {
      "@id": "eh:wad",
      "type": "lexinfo:semanticallyRelated"
    }
  ]
}
```

This entry:
1. Documents both physical and metaphorical meanings
2. Links to related term 'wad' (path, way)
3. Shows the Proto-Hick etymology
4. Marks it as a verb
5. Includes semantic field cross-references
6. Follows the established ontolex-lemon format

Would you like me to add entries for any of the derived forms like wardok?

## User:


[text]  
hmmm I think it's a bit strange that it would come from wardu from proto-hick. perhaps it would be good to see if we can make it cognate with wad. can you suggest reconstructions from proto-hick with that in mind?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the lexicon, we can see 'wad' is from Proto-Hick *wadu:


```156:164:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - thral [θral] "sacred, ritual; day" < Proto-Hick \*thralu → thral
### Sacred & Ritual
   - thral [θral] "sacred, ritual; day" < Proto-Hick \*thralu → thral
1. Basic Terms
   - thral [θral] "sacred, ritual; day" < Proto-Hick \*thralu → thral
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
     See: [Time Terms](#time--celestial)
   - thren [θren] "watch, observe (ritual)" < Proto-Hick \*threnu → thren
```


For 'ward', we could reconstruct it as a derived form from the same root. Common 
cross-linguistic patterns show directional/causative meanings often come from path/way 
terms through suffixation.

Proposal:
Proto-Hick *wad-ru → ward (path/way-CAUS) "make/show the way" → "guide, direct"

The sound changes would be:
1. *wad-ru → wadru (suffixation)
2. wadru → ward (cluster simplification)
3. ward → ward (final vowel loss not needed as it's already consonant-final)

This:
1. Links it etymologically to 'wad' "path, way"
2. Explains the semantic shift from "path" to "guide/direct"
3. Uses a plausible causative *-ru suffix in Proto-Hick
4. Follows natural sound change patterns
5. Maintains the established relationship between the terms

Would you like me to update both the markdown lexicon entry and the ontolex-lemon 
documentation with this revised etymology?

## User:


[text]  
do we have that causative documented in @proto-hick.md or are you inventing that?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking through proto-hick.md, I don't see any documentation of a *-ru causative suffix. I was inventing that without proper justification.

Looking at the Proto-Hick documentation, we can see the actual pattern for 'wad':

```markdown:site/content/languages/hickic/proto-hick.md
startLine: 165
endLine: 169
9. Final Vowel Loss
   - \*-u > ∅ / \_#
   - Extremely regular:
     - \*thralu → thral "sacred"
     - \*wadu → wad "path"
```

And we can see that 'ward' isn't documented in the Proto-Hick reconstructions. 
Perhaps instead of inventing a causative suffix, we should look at other attested 
patterns in Proto-Hick for deriving directional/motion terms.

Looking at the directional system development:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hickic/proto-hick.md
startLine: 279
endLine: 289
1. Illative (-aes)
   - From Proto-Hick \*lawes "consume/take in"
   - Sound changes:
     - *lawes > *laes > -aes
   - Parallel development with \*wel > bel "mouth"
   - Original compound: \*wel-lawes "mouth-consume"
     - > *wellaes > *belaes "intake"
     - Grammaticalized to directional marker -aes
```

Would you like me to propose a different etymology for 'ward' based on attested 
Proto-Hick patterns rather than inventing a causative suffix?

## User:


[text]  
in early hick, i think causative constructions would be similar to the Change of State construction described in our Adjectival Morphology
