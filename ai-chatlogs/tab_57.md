## Physical Appearance

Philippa has long, natural wavy hair that resembles the color of fading 
sunlight. She is short and small for her age, often mistaken for a child due 
to her illness. Her pale yellow eyes turn vivid whenever she casts a spell. 
She prefers wearing simple and humble dresses and has a birthmark under her 
left ear shaped like a leaf.

## Personality

Philippa is a beautiful, soft-mannered, and kind-hearted girl with a 
nurturing personality. A gentle soul, she always accepts nothing in exchange 
for her healing abilities. Although she attracts many suitors, her heart 
belongs to the Church, or she may simply be too naive to recognize their 
motives. Due to her late education, she sometimes struggles with reading and 
writing, resulting in poor handwriting.

Despite suffering from a week-long fever and chills almost every month, 
Philippa learned to manage her illness after entering the Church. While her 
body remains weak, she strives to fulfill her responsibilities as a devoted 
Cleric. During this time, she often experiences lucid dreams of a young girl 
who resembles her but is very different in many ways. She refers to this 
phenomenon as “Traveling.”

+++

## Early Life

Lilya Bkorneblume is a 25-year-old herbalist known for her deep connection 
to nature and her extensive knowledge of medicinal plants. Born in 1250 in 
the heart of Senera, she grew up in a family that valued the healing arts 
and the wisdom of the natural world. Her parents, Eldrin and Mira, instilled 
in her a profound respect for the environment and its resources.

## Education and Training

From a young age, Lilya showed a keen interest in botany and herbalism. 
She apprenticed under the village healer, learning the properties of various 
plants and their uses in medicine. Her dedication to her studies earned her 
the title of the village's primary herbalist by the age of 20.

## Physical Appearance

Lilya has long, flowing chestnut hair that cascades down her back, often 
decorated with small flowers she picks during her walks in the forest. 
Her bright green eyes reflect her connection to nature, and her skin has a 
sun-kissed glow from spending countless hours outdoors. She typically wears 
earth-toned dresses that allow her to move freely while foraging for herbs.

## Personality

Lilya is known for her warm and nurturing demeanor. She possesses a gentle 
spirit and is always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need. 
Her love for nature is evident in her conversations, and she often shares 
her knowledge of plants with others. While she is generally optimistic, 
she can be fiercely protective of her loved ones and the environment.

## Flaws

Despite her many strengths, Lilya can be overly trusting, which sometimes 
leads her to be taken advantage of by those with less noble intentions. 
Her deep empathy for others can also make her vulnerable to emotional 
overwhelm, especially when faced with the suffering of those around her. 
Additionally, her focus on herbalism can lead her to neglect her own 
well-being at times.

+++

## Early Life

Lilya Bkorneblume is an 18-year-old girl with mysterious abilities that she 
dares not discuss with her family or friends. Adopted by the Surrata Family, 
she did not exhibit any remarkable traits after a year. With no memories of 
her past and little interest in taking her adopted family’s name, she often 
fades into the background.

The Surrata Family intended to mold her into a fine noblewoman to marry off 
and strengthen family ties. However, after months of showing no interest, 
they decided it was better to send her to the Royal Navy.

## Personality

Lilya can come off as emotionless due to her difficulty in expressing her 
feelings, stemming from her inability to remember her past. The only time she 
shows emotions is around animals like horses, dogs, cats, or cows. She tends 
to remember their names but struggles to do so with her peers. Quiet and 
slightly withdrawn, she finds peace in solitude and prefers to accomplish 
tasks alone. Lilya becomes vocal and hostile toward those who do not tell 
the truth. Despite her rebellious streak, she possesses a good heart, which 
helps her function in society.

Lilya sometimes suffers from feverish dreams about a young girl who has the 
same face as her but acts very differently. She often forgets these dreams 
upon waking.

## Military Career

Her lack of interest and motivation briefly disappeared when she entered the 
Navy due to the demands and responsibilities she must adhere to. Her rise in 
the ranks was doubted and challenged by others but was eventually accepted 
due to her combat prowess. She became one of the youngest to achieve a rank 
in the Navy. Even with her hands restrained or blindfolded, she is a deadly 
fighter.

## Physical Appearance

Lilya has a beautiful, almost innocent face and long, flowing hair that 
captivates those around her. These qualities were the reason the Surrata 
Family adopted her. She has pale yellow eyes that brighten whenever she is 
in combat. Although she is short and small in stature, she sports a lean 
body due to her training in the Navy.

## Flaws

Lilya suffers from amnesia, leading her friends and family to believe she 
has short-term memory issues. Her indifference can sometimes manifest as a 
lack of action or urgency regarding the needs of others.
