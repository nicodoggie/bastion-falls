I think we lost some of the discussion about @early-hick using its demonstratives for discourse marking. could you source it again from @ai-chatlogs please>


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Let me look through the chat logs for discussions about demonstratives and discourse marking:

```markdown:ai-chatlogs/Clarifying the Agentive Suffix -ok.md
startLine: 1599
endLine: 1611
```

This shows a brief mention of demonstratives being used for discourse reference, similar to Finnish's system. However, I don't see the full original discussion in the provided logs.

Would you like me to:
1. Look through other chat logs for the original discussion about discourse marking?
2. Document what we know about the demonstrative system's discourse functions based on what we have?
3. Propose how the demonstrative system might have developed these discourse marking functions?

The key point we have documented is that demonstratives can track referents in discourse:
- -is/Ê”is for most recent mention
- -en/tan for previous mentions
- -eth/thir for established/salient referents

But we might want to find the original discussion to ensure we have all the details correct.

I think there should be more reference in older logs in @ai-chatlogs 


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

I'll help look through the older logs for discussions about demonstratives and discourse marking. From what I can see in the provided snippets, we have several relevant discussions:

1. The development of demonstratives with animacy marking:
```markdown:ai-chatlogs/Tidemark City Governance and Establishments.md
startLine: 1542
endLine: 1605
```

2. The discussion about Finnish-style demonstrative discourse tracking:
```markdown:ai-chatlogs/Tidemark City Governance and Establishments.md
startLine: 2138
endLine: 2143
```

However, I don't see the full discussion about Finnish's demonstrative system in the provided logs. Would you like me to:

1. Propose how Early Hick could use demonstratives for discourse tracking similar to Finnish?
2. Look through more chat logs for the original discussion?
3. Document what we know about the demonstrative system's functions based on what we have?

The key elements we have documented are:
- Animacy distinctions in demonstratives
- Three-way distance marking (proximal/medial/distal)
- Some use in discourse reference

But we might want to find the original discussion about Finnish's system to ensure we're implementing it correctly.

we have reference to "archaic locatives" in early hick documentation. these are supposedly in the proto-hick docs I think. but are there cases of long obsolete forms being still somewhat productive again?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the code blocks, I see references to archaic locatives in a few places:

```markdown:ai-chatlogs/Lexicon Consistency and Rule Violation Analysis.md
startLine: 11148
endLine: 11154
```

This shows `ran` as an archaic locative meaning "here". And we see some Proto-Hick directional development:

```markdown:ai-chatlogs/Discussion on Hick Language Consonant Clusters.md
startLine: 6146
endLine: 6173
```

To answer your question about obsolete forms becoming productive again - yes, this happens in natural languages! Some examples:

1. English "thou/thee" becoming productive again in certain dialects
2. Sanskrit locative case endings being repurposed in Hindi
3. Old Japanese particles being revived in literary language

For Early Hick, we could show this with:
- Archaic locative `ran` surviving in fixed expressions
- Getting repurposed as an emphatic marker
- Combining with newer demonstratives: `ran istel` "right here"

Would you like me to:
1. Document more examples of revived archaic forms?
2. Show how they interact with the newer demonstrative system?
3. Trace their development through Middle/Late Hick?
