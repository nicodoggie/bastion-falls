we need to derive a word for addition/union in @early-hick from @proto-hick.md .

perhaps from kinship terminology, similar th bran meaning branch...


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Let me help derive a word for "addition/union" in Early Hick based on Proto-Hick roots and kinship terminology.

Looking at the relevant sections:


```527:534:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
   - merlis [mer.lis] "offspring" < mer-lis "parent-child" → merlis
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - bran [bran] "lineage, family branch" < Proto-Hick \*bahu lu-haranu → bran
     (lit. "split from father")
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
     ([liquid deletion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#sound-changes-in-compounds))
     Note: Same term used for tree branch; see
     [Flora Terms](#flora--agriculture)
```


We see that kinship and branching concepts are connected through `bran` meaning both "lineage, family branch" and "tree branch", derived from Proto-Hick *bahu lu-haranu (literally "split from father").


```527:532:site/content/languages/hickic/proto-hick.md

```


Based on this pattern and Proto-Hick morphology, we could derive a word for "addition/union" from:

Proto-Hick *mer-lisu ("parent-child") > Early Hick `merlis`

Therefore, I suggest:

Proto-Hick *mer-haranu ("parent-join") > Early Hick `meran`

The development would follow:
1. Compound formation of *mer ("parent") + *haranu ("join")
2. Regular sound changes:
   - Final vowel loss (*haranu > *haran)
   - Initial h-loss in compounds (*merharan > *meran)
   - Preservation of r due to semantic importance

The semantic development makes sense because:
1. It builds on existing kinship terminology
2. Uses the concept of joining/uniting families through parenthood
3. Follows similar patterns to `bran` but with opposite meaning (joining vs splitting)
4. Maintains the important cultural connection between family relations and abstract concepts

The word `meran` could then mean both:
1. "to join families through marriage/parenthood" (concrete meaning)
2. "to add, unite, join" (abstract mathematical/logical meaning)

This follows Early Hick's pattern of deriving abstract concepts from concrete family/natural relationships.

## User:

joining of two families? right? so perhaps we need a word for family first. what are typical etymologies for words that mean family?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the lexicon, I notice several relevant patterns for family-related terms:


```527:554:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
   - merlis [mer.lis] "offspring" < mer-lis "parent-child" → merlis
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - bran [bran] "lineage, family branch" < Proto-Hick \*bahu lu-haranu → bran
     (lit. "split from father")
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
     ([liquid deletion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#sound-changes-in-compounds))
     Note: Same term used for tree branch; see
     [Flora Terms](#flora--agriculture)
   - thirmer [θir.mer] "grandparent" < thir-mer "elder-parent" → thirmer
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - thirlis [θir.lis] "grandchild" < thir-lis "elder-child" → thirlis
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - tormer [tor.mer] "ancestor" < tor-mer "great-parent" → tormer
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - limer [li.mer] "younger parent/aunt/uncle" < li-mer "small-parent" → limer
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - thirbao [θir.ba.o] "grandfather" < thir-bao "elder-father" → thirbao
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - thirnai [θir.nai] "grandmother" < thir-nai "elder-mother" → thirnai
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - torbao [tor.ba.o] "ancestor (paternal)" < tor-bao "great-father" → torbao
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - tornai [tor.nai] "ancestor (maternal)" < tor-nai "great-mother" → tornai
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - libao [li.ba.o] "uncle (paternal)" < li-bao "lesser-father" → libao
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - linai [li.nai] "aunt (maternal)" < li-nai "lesser-mother" → linai
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
```


From this section, we can see that Early Hick has:
1. `bran` meaning "lineage, family branch" from Proto-Hick *bahu lu-haranu
2. Several kinship terms using compounds with `mer` ("parent"), `lis` ("child"), 
`bao` ("father"), and `nai` ("mother")

Common etymologies for "family" across languages often come from:
1. Words for "house/dwelling"
2. Words for "hearth/fire"
3. Words for "seed/offspring"
4. Words for "gathering/group"

Looking at Proto-Hick phonology and compounds:


```34:55:site/content/languages/hickic/proto-hick.md
### Vowels

|      | Front | Central | Back |
| ---- | ----- | ------- | ---- |
| High | i     |         | u    |
| Mid  | e     |         | o    |
| Low  |       | a       |      |

## Phonotactics

### Syllable Structure

1. Basic Pattern: (C)CV(C)

   - Initial C required (ʔ if no other consonant)
   - No complex onsets or codas
   - Final C optional

2. Examples:
   - \*ʔahi "water"
   - \*muru "night"
   - \*telu "place"
```


I suggest deriving a word for "family" first:

Proto-Hick *meru-alu ("parent-group") > Early Hick `meral`
- Following regular sound changes:
  - Compound formation
  - Final vowel loss
  - Liquid deletion in compounds

Then for "join/unite families":

Proto-Hick *meral-wesu ("family-join") > Early Hick `merawes`
- Using the same root as seen in `duwes` ("consume" < *sedu-lawes)
- Following similar compound patterns
- Semantic development: "family-join" → "unite families" → "join/unite" (general)

This gives us:
- `meral` [me.ral] "family" < Proto-Hick *meru-alu
- `merawes` [me.ra.wes] "join, unite" < Proto-Hick *meral-wesu

The etymology makes sense because:
1. Uses established kinship terminology root `mer`
2. Follows attested compound patterns
3. Shows similar semantic development to `bran`
4. Uses the joining/consuming morpheme *wesu seen in other compounds

## User:


[text]  
is alu an attested word for group?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking through the provided code snippets, I don't see *alu directly attested as "group". The closest reference I can find is in this section:


```598:599:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
   - ma-thal [ma.θal] "group (of people)" < ma-thal "PL-three" → mathal
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
```


This shows that 'group' is expressed through `mathal`, derived from "PL-three".

I apologize for my previous suggestion about *meru-alu. While we can reconstruct words based on Proto-Hick patterns, we should stick to attested forms or clearly documented roots when possible. Would you like to explore other attested words that might work for expressing "joining of families"?

## User:


[text]  
hmm perhaps the use of ma'al for tribe? can that also be a word for family?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the relevant sections:


```496:499:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
   - ma'al [ma.ʔal] "community, tribe" < ma-'al "COLL-person" → ma'al
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
  See: [Political Terms](#political-terms)
  Note: Collective term implying social/political unity rather than simple plurality
```


We see `ma'al` meaning "community, tribe" derived from `ma-'al` "COLL-person", with the note that it implies social/political unity rather than simple plurality.

This could work well for "family" too, since:

1. It uses the collective prefix `ma-` which is used for groups
2. The base is `'al` ("person")
3. The note specifically mentions social unity rather than just plurality
4. It follows Early Hick's pattern of extending political/social terms to family concepts

So we could extend the semantic range of `ma'al` to mean:
1. "family" (smallest social unit)
2. "community/tribe" (larger social unit)
3. "people" (largest social unit)

This semantic development (family → tribe → people) is common cross-linguistically and fits with Early Hick's attested patterns of semantic extension.

For "joining of families" we could then use:
`ma'alwes` [ma.ʔal.wes] "join families/communities" < ma'al-wes "tribe-join"

This follows the attested pattern seen in:

```733:735:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
   - duwes [du.wes] "eat, consume" < sedu-lawes "seed-consume" → duwes
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
     See: [Directional System](#directional-system)
```


Where we see `duwes` "eat, consume" derived from a similar compound structure.

## User:


[text]  
would it be common that the older form of "family" become the word for community/tribe, then a newer word from the present state of the language be coined? or the other way around?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the lexicon entries, we can see that `ma'al` is already established as "community, tribe":


```496:499:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
   - ma'al [ma.ʔal] "community, tribe" < ma-'al "COLL-person" → ma'al
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
  See: [Political Terms](#political-terms)
  Note: Collective term implying social/political unity rather than simple plurality
```


Cross-linguistically, it's more common for words meaning "family" to expand their meaning to cover larger social groups over time, rather than the other way around. For example:
- Latin "familia" originally meant "household" including servants, then expanded to mean "family lineage" and later "group with common characteristics"
- PIE *ǵenh₁- "to beget" → "family" → "tribe/race/kind" in many descendants

So it would make more sense for Early Hick to have:

1. An older word for "family" that expanded to mean "tribe/community" (`ma'al`)
2. A newer word coined specifically for "family" using productive compounds

Looking at the kinship terminology and compound patterns:


```509:554:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md

     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
```


We could derive a new word for "family" using:
- `mer` ("parent") 
- `'al` ("person")

Giving us: `mer'al` [mer.ʔal] "family" (literally "parent-people")

This follows established patterns:
1. Uses core kinship term `mer`
2. Follows compound formation rules
3. Makes semantic sense as "people belonging to parents"
4. Contrasts nicely with `ma'al` "tribe" (COLL-person)

So the historical development would be:
1. Original word for family: *mer'al
2. Semantic expansion: *mer'al → ma'al "tribe/community"
3. New word coined: mer'al "family" (modern compound)

[text]  
I don't know if I do like that mer is a metaphorical extension of bird. doesn't make much sense to me...


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

You make a good point. Looking at the kinship terminology, we can see that `mer` is a fundamental root for "parent" that appears in many compounds:


```527:554:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
   - merlis [mer.lis] "offspring" < mer-lis "parent-child" → merlis
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))

     Note: Same term used for tree branch; see
     [Flora Terms](#flora--agriculture)
   - thirmer [θir.mer] "grandparent" < thir-mer "elder-parent" → thirmer
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - thirlis [θir.lis] "grandchild" < thir-lis "elder-child" → thirlis
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - tormer [tor.mer] "ancestor" < tor-mer "great-parent" → tormer
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - limer [li.mer] "younger parent/aunt/uncle" < li-mer "small-parent" → limer
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - thirbao [θir.ba.o] "grandfather" < thir-bao "elder-father" → thirbao
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - thirnai [θir.nai] "grandmother" < thir-nai "elder-mother" → thirnai
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - torbao [tor.ba.o] "ancestor (paternal)" < tor-bao "great-father" → torbao
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - tornai [tor.nai] "ancestor (maternal)" < tor-nai "great-mother" → tornai
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - libao [li.ba.o] "uncle (paternal)" < li-bao "lesser-father" → libao
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - linai [li.nai] "aunt (maternal)" < li-nai "lesser-mother" → linai
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
```


The compounds show `mer` consistently meaning "parent" in:
- merlis "offspring" (parent-child)
- thirmer "grandparent" (elder-parent)
- tormer "ancestor" (great-parent)
- limer "younger parent/aunt/uncle" (small-parent)

Having it be a metaphorical extension from "bird" seems less plausible than it being a core kinship term in Proto-Hick. Many languages have basic, non-derived terms for "parent" that are among their oldest vocabulary.

Would you like to explore alternative etymologies for `mer` that would make more sense as a Proto-Hick root word for "parent"? We could look at:

1. Having it be a basic Proto-Hick kinship term *meru
2. Deriving it from a different metaphorical source that makes more sense
3. Finding a compound origin that better fits the semantic development

What direction would you prefer to explore?

## User:


[text]  
perhaps they're homonyms that evolved from different roots from proto-hick. mer would be the older term, so perhaps with more semantic/sound shifts, with bird derived from some related term to flight


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, that makes much more sense! Looking at the patterns in Early Hick, we could have:

1. `mer` [mer] "parent" < Proto-Hick *meru "parent/caregiver" (basic kinship term)
- Shows regular final vowel loss
- Appears in many core kinship compounds:

```527:540:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
   - merlis [mer.lis] "offspring" < mer-lis "parent-child" → merlis
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - bran [bran] "lineage, family branch" < Proto-Hick \*bahu lu-haranu → bran
     (lit. "split from father")
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
     ([liquid deletion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#sound-changes-in-compounds))
     Note: Same term used for tree branch; see
     [Flora Terms](#flora--agriculture)
   - thirmer [θir.mer] "grandparent" < thir-mer "elder-parent" → thirmer
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - thirlis [θir.lis] "grandchild" < thir-lis "elder-child" → thirlis
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - tormer [tor.mer] "ancestor" < tor-mer "great-parent" → tormer
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
```


2. `mer` [mer] "bird" < Proto-Hick *meweru "flyer/wing-haver"
- Shows more complex sound changes:
  - Medial *w loss between identical vowels
  - Final vowel loss
  - Vowel coalescence (*meeru > *meer > mer)
- Later semantic narrowing to "bird"

This explains:
1. Why the kinship `mer` is so productive in compounds
2. Why it shows such regular patterns
3. Why the "bird" meaning feels less central to the language's semantic system

The homonymy would be a later development as the two originally distinct Proto-Hick words converged through different sound change paths.

This also better aligns with cross-linguistic patterns where basic kinship terms tend to be very old and resistant to metaphorical extension, while animal terms more commonly derive from descriptive compounds or action words.

I suppose we can construct hickic folklore that connects parenthood and birds

Yes! Looking at the bird terminology and kinship sections:

     Note: Developed from animate form of *lisu "eye", showing semantic shift
     from physical perception to conscious learning/development
```


We could develop a cultural connection where:

1. The Proto-Hick people saw birds, especially owls, as exemplars of parental care:
   - They feed their young directly
   - They teach their offspring to fly
   - They watch over their nests at night
   - They make distinct calls to communicate with their young

2. The word *meru could have originally meant both "to nurture/care for" and "to feed young (as birds do)", with the meanings splitting into:
   - mer "parent" (abstract nurturing)
   - mer "bird" (concrete nurturing)

3. This could be reflected in folklore where:
   - Owls (murmer) are seen as wise parent figures
   - The "night-eye" (murlis) represents parental watchfulness
   - The different sizes of owls (tomur, limur) represent different generations or roles in the family

This cultural connection would explain:
1. Why both meanings persisted
2. Why bird terms use mer productively
3. Why mer became the general term for "parent" rather than just "father" or "mother"
4. The semantic link between "watching/teaching" and "parenthood" seen in lis "child" < "one who sees/perceives"

## User:


[text]  
as for links with child and one who percieves, I think that could be a coincidence, since we have a diminuitive li-


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

You're right about `lis` - looking at the relevant sections:


```763:774:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
1. Basic Terms

   - lis [lis] "eye" < Proto-Hick \*lisu → lis
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
     See: [Body Parts](#body-parts), [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual)
   - his [his] "sight" < Proto-Hick \*hi-lisu → his
     ([liquid deletion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#sound-changes-in-compounds),
     [vowel coalescence](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
     See: [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual)
   - mulis [mu.lis] "dream, vision" < Proto-Hick \*muruhilisu → mulis
     ([compound reduction](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-simplification))
     See: [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual)
```


We see `lis` means "eye" in Proto-Hick (*lisu), and the animate prefix *hi- gives *hi-lisu "sight". The connection to "child" seems more likely to be through the diminutive `li-` as you suggest.

Looking at the diminutive prefix usage:


```405:423:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
1. Visible/Known
### Similarity Marking
   - -ʔis [ʔis] "this" (animate)
1. Similarity Prefix (ka-)
   - Prefix meaning "like, similar to"
   - Always surfaces as [kə-] due to regular vowel reduction
   - Examples:
     - ka-tor [kə.tor] "hill-like" (smaller than a mountain)
     - ka-mal [kə.mal] "pond-like" (smaller than a lake)
     - ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)
2. Usage Domains
   - Natural Features: kətor "hill-like", kəmal "pond-like"
   - Animals: kəpel "bear-like", kəmer "bird-like"
   - Body Parts: kəbel "mouth-like", kəven "wing-like"
   - Weather: kəbran "storm-like", kəthral "mist-like"
   - Water Movement: kəran "stream-like", kəthrim "wave-like"
   - Plant Growth: kəthir "grass-like", kəbel "vine-like"
   - Sounds: kəmer "bird-like (sound)", kəsak "wolf-like (howl)"

```


The diminutive `li-` is used productively to form words meaning "smaller version of X" or "like X but lesser". This suggests that `lis` "child" could simply be from Proto-Hick *li-su "small person/being", following regular sound changes, rather than being connected to perception/sight.

This makes more sense because:
1. It follows the regular diminutive pattern
2. It's simpler than deriving it from "one who perceives"
3. It aligns with cross-linguistic patterns where words for "child" often come from diminutives
4. It explains why `lis` appears in compounds like `merlis` "offspring" without any connection to sight/perception

Would you like to explore this alternative etymology for `lis` further?

[text]  
let's continue with talking about mer first. perhaps the nurture word may have been preserved through a sacred term thimer, then the mer word can have those senses

Yes! Looking at the sacred terminology and bird sections:

We see a rich vocabulary around nocturnal birds, particularly owls. And in the sacred terms:


```161:172:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
   - thral [θral] "sacred, ritual; day" < Proto-Hick \*thralu → thral

     See: [Maritime Terms](#maritime-terms)
2. Time & Light
```


We could propose:

1. Proto-Hick *thimeru "to nurture/care for (sacred)" > Early Hick `thimer`
   - Used in ritual contexts
   - Related to caring for sacred spaces/objects
   - Preserved the original nurturing sense

2. Proto-Hick *meru "bird" > Early Hick `mer`
   - Basic term for "bird"
   - Especially associated with owls through compounds like `murmer`
   - Later extended to mean "parent" through cultural association

This explains:
1. Why `mer` appears in both bird and kinship terms
2. Why owl terminology is so developed
3. How the nurturing sense was preserved through sacred vocabulary
4. Why `thimer` would be used in ritual contexts

The semantic development would be:
1. Proto-Hick *thimeru "sacred nurturing"
2. Proto-Hick *meru "bird" (especially owls)
3. Early Hick `thimer` preserves original "nurture" meaning in sacred contexts
4. Early Hick `mer` extends from "bird" to "parent" through cultural metaphor
5. Both meanings coexist in Early Hick with clear domains of use

This better explains the lexical patterns we see while maintaining the cultural connection between birds and parenting.

## User:


[text]  
let's say that thimer means something along the lines of "spiritual nurturing, penitence"


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Yes! Looking at the sacred terminology and spirit terms:


```487:496:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
   - imer [i.mer] "breath, soul" < Proto-Hick \*imeru → imer
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
     See: [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual)
   - imeraes [i.me.raes] "inspiration" < imer-aes "soul-inward" → imeraes
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - imerimris [i.me.rim.ris] "expression" < imer-imris "soul-outward" →
     imerimris
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
3. Derived Terms
   - ma'al [ma.ʔal] "community, tribe" < ma-'al "COLL-person" → ma'al
```


We see `imer` meaning "breath, soul" with derivatives like `imeraes` "inspiration" and `imerimris` "expression". 

So `thimer` could be from Proto-Hick *thi-imeru "sacred-soul/breath" meaning "spiritual nurturing, penitence", which would:

1. Connect to the sacred/ritual domain through `thi-` (sacred)
2. Connect to the nurturing sense through `imer` (soul/breath)
3. Explain why `mer` appears in both:
   - Sacred compounds (spiritual nurturing)
   - Bird terms (physical nurturing)
   - Kinship terms (familial nurturing)

The semantic development could be:

Proto-Hick:
- *thi-imeru "sacred-soul" > "spiritual nurturing"
- *meru "bird" (especially nurturing birds like owls)

Early Hick:
- `thimer` "spiritual nurturing, penitence" (sacred domain)
- `mer` "bird" > extended to "parent" through cultural metaphor
- `murmer` "owl" (seen as exemplar of nurturing)

This explains:
1. Why `mer` has both bird and parent meanings
2. Why owls are significant in the lexicon
3. How nurturing concepts link sacred and familial domains
4. Why `thimer` preserves an older meaning in ritual contexts

The connection between spiritual and physical nurturing would be a core cultural concept, preserved in both sacred terminology and kinship terms.

## User:


[text]  
so here's the sequence:
 - meru "nurture/care"
 - hameru "care for the sacred, keep sacrosanct" 
   - θameru > θəmeru > θimer
 - meru "bird/parent" because of cultural connection with birds as being best parents


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, this sequence makes perfect sense! Let's break it down:

1. Proto-Hick *meru "nurture/care" (basic term)
   - Shows up in sacred compounds
   - Core meaning of nurturing/caring

2. Proto-Hick *ha-meru "sacred-nurture" > Early Hick `thimer`
   - Sound changes:

```161:166:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md

   - wad [wad] "path, way" < Proto-Hick \*wadu → wad
```

   - Parallels other sacred terms with `thi-/θi-` prefix
   - Specialized meaning of spiritual nurturing/penitence

3. Proto-Hick *meru "bird/parent"
   - Cultural connection through bird behavior, especially owls:

```267:282:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
   - murmer [mur.mer] "night-bird, owl" < Proto-Hick \*muru-meru "night-bird" →

   - limur [li.mur] "small night-bird, small owl" < Proto-Hick \*li-muru-meru
```

   - Rich vocabulary of owl terms showing their cultural importance
   - Metaphorical extension to parenting based on bird behavior

This explains:
1. Why `mer` appears in both sacred and kinship vocabulary
2. Why nocturnal birds (especially owls) have such developed terminology
3. The connection between spiritual and physical nurturing
4. The preservation of the original "nurture" meaning in sacred contexts through `thimer`

The semantic development follows natural patterns:
- Basic term for "nurture" > sacred specialized meaning
- Concrete term "bird" > metaphorical extension to "parent"
- Both meanings preserved in different domains

[text]  
Ok now, let's document the cultural relationship for mer in proto-hick, and the evolution of thimer


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Let's document the evolution of these terms based on the lexical evidence. Looking at the sacred terms, spirit terms, and bird terminology:

Proto-Hick:
1. *meru "to nurture, care for"
   - Basic meaning preserved in ritual contexts
   - Shows up in compounds about spiritual care

2. *ha-meru "sacred-nurture" > Early Hick `thimer`
   - Sound changes:
     - *ha- > *θa- (sacred prefix spirantization)
     - *θameru > *θəmeru (unstressed vowel reduction)
     - *θəmeru > thimer (final vowel loss)
   - Used specifically for spiritual nurturing and penitence
   - Connected to `imer` "breath, soul" (lines 487-495)

3. *meru "bird" (especially owls)
   - Developed from the nurturing sense
   - Particularly associated with nocturnal birds who were seen as spiritual guides
   - Rich vocabulary preserved in owl terms (lines 267-291)

Cultural connections:
1. Birds, especially owls, were seen as spiritual nurturers:
   - `murmer` "night-bird, owl" - guides in darkness
   - `tomur` "great owl" - spiritual authority
   - `thurmur` "dusk owl" - transition guide
   - `limur` "small owl" - lesser spirit guide

2. The sacred-nurture term `thimer` preserved in:
   - Ritual contexts
   - Sacred spaces (`thragral` "garden" < "sacred-earth", lines 147-151)
   - Spiritual guidance

3. The general nurturing sense evolved into:
   - `mer` "parent" (lines 510-525)
   - Various kinship compounds (lines 528-555)
   - Bird terminology (lines 267-291)

This explains:
1. Why `mer` appears in both sacred and kinship vocabulary
2. Why nocturnal birds have such developed terminology
3. The connection between spiritual and physical nurturing
4. The preservation of the original "nurture" meaning in sacred contexts through `thimer

[text]  
can we format it to fit @proto-hick.md 


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes! Here's how we could document this in Proto-Hick style:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hickic/proto-hick.md
## Proto-Hick *meru

1. Basic Forms:
   - *meru "to nurture, care for" (original meaning)
   - *ha-meru "sacred nurture" (sacred compound)
   - *meru "bird" (metaphorical extension)

2. Development Path:
   a. Early Proto-Hick:
      - *meru primary meaning "nurture/care"
      - Used in sacred compounds with *ha-
      - Cultural association with birds as nurturers
   
   b. Late Proto-Hick:
      - *ha-meru > *θameru (sacred prefix spirantization)
      - *θameru > *θəmeru (unstressed vowel reduction)
      - *meru specializes in bird terminology
   
   c. Early Hick:
      - *θəmeru > thimer "spiritual nurturing, penitence"
      - mer "bird" and "parent" (dual meaning preserved)
      - Rich owl terminology develops

3. Semantic Development:
   - Original: "nurture, care for"
   - Sacred: "spiritual nurturing" (*ha-meru > thimer)
   - Extended: "bird" (especially nurturing birds)
   - Further extended: "parent" (from bird metaphor)

4. Examples:
   - *muru-meru "night-bird" > murmer "owl"
   - *toru-muru-meru "great-night-bird" > tomur "great owl"
   - *mer-lisu "parent-child" > merlis "offspring"

5. Cultural Context:
   - Birds, especially owls, seen as exemplars of nurturing
   - Sacred nurturing preserved in ritual terminology
   - Parental nurturing preserved in kinship terms
```

This follows the format seen in Proto-Hick reconstructions, particularly matching:


```392:421:site/content/languages/hickic/proto-hick.md
   - Post-nominal position
   - Often used with topical or previously mentioned referents
   - Shows agreement with animacy in early stages
   
3. Examples:
   - *telu mela "the place" (inanimate)
   - *kalu mela "the person" (animate)
   - *mel-toru "the height" (in compounds)

4. Development in Early Hick:
   - Splits into two distinct morphemes:
     a. Definite article: mel- > -el (cliticized to noun)
     b. Ergative case: mel- > -el (homophonous but distinct)
   - Position shifts from post-nominal to pre-nominal
   - Animacy distinction lost

```


And the semantic development patterns shown in:


```289:315:site/content/languages/hickic/proto-hick.md
     - Grammaticalized to directional marker -aes
2. Ellative (-imris)
   - From compound: *imer "breath" + *is "out"
   - Shows parallel grammaticalization:
     - Body action > directional marker
   - Preserved in forms like:
     - imeraes "inspiration" (soul-inward)
     - imerimris "expression" (soul-outward)
3. Example Usage
   - materok rismateraes kethes "the boatman (goes) into the reed boat"
   - materok rismaterimris kethes "the boatman (goes) out from the reed boat"

## Negation System Development

1. Proto-Hick Stage:
   - \*mur "darkness, absence" (full lexical word)
   - Used in compounds to indicate lack/absence
2. Early Proto-Hick:
   - \*mur becomes preverbal particle marking negation
   - \*mur ter "not flow" (lit. "absence flow")
3. Late Proto-Hick:
   - Unstressed position leads to reduction:
   - *mur > *mu (liquid deletion in unstressed position)
4. Early Hick:

   - Further reduction in unstressed prefix position:
   - \*mu- > mo-

The cross-references connect all the semantic domains where `mer` and its derivatives appear, showing the interconnected meanings of nurturing across physical, spiritual, and familial contexts.

## User:


[text]  
thimer and mer are not related to imer despite their similarity


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Ah, I apologize for the confusion! You're right - looking at the lexicon entries, `imer` "breath, soul" (lines 488-495) is a distinct lexeme from `thimer` "spiritual nurturing" and `mer` "bird/parent".

Let me revise the cross-references to remove that incorrect connection:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Sacred & Ritual
   - thimer [θi.mer] "spiritual nurturing, penitence" < Proto-Hick *ha-meru → thimer
     ([vowel reduction](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
     See: [Bird Terms](#bird-terms-nocturnal), [Kinship Terms](#kinship-terms)
     Note: Preserves original nurturing sense in sacred context
```

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Person Terms
   - mer [mer] "parent; bird" < Proto-Hick *meru → mer
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
     See: [Bird Terms](#bird-terms-nocturnal), [Kinship Terms](#kinship-terms)
     Note: Cultural connection between birds and parenting
```

And for the JSON-LD, we should remove any connection to `imer` in the related terms:

```json:data/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.jsonld
{
  "@id": "eh:mer",
  "related": [
    {
      "@id": "eh:thimer",
      "type": "lexinfo:etymologicallyRelated"
    },
    {
      "@id": "eh:murmer",
      "type": "lexinfo:semanticallyRelated"
    }
  ]
}
```

This better reflects that while `thimer` and `mer` share an etymological connection through Proto-Hick *meru, `imer` is a separate lexeme with its own distinct etymology and semantic development.

## User:


[text]  
you're forgetting to cross reference mer in animal terms and in kinship terms too


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Ah yes! We need to add cross-references in those sections too. Looking at lines 243-255 for Animals and the Bird Terms section (lines 275-285), let's add proper cross-references:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Animals
   - mer [mer] "bird" < Proto-Hick *meru → mer
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
     See: [Bird Terms](#bird-terms-nocturnal), [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual), 
     [Kinship Terms](#kinship-terms)
     Note: Cultural connection between birds and parenting roles
```

And in the Kinship Terms section:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Kinship Terms
1. Basic Terms
   - mer [mer] "parent" < Proto-Hick *meru → mer

     See: [Bird Terms](#bird-terms-nocturnal), [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual), 
     [Animals](#animals)
     Note: Metaphorical extension from bird terminology reflecting cultural values
```

This follows the cross-referencing patterns seen in:


```161:171:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
   - thral [θral] "sacred, ritual; day" < Proto-Hick \*thralu → thral

[text]  
could the word for one [sin] come from proto-hick [su] for one? then lisu meaning small one for child?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, that's a plausible etymology! Looking at the number system and kinship terms:

   - ren [ren] "deer" < Proto-Hick \*renu → ren
```


We can reconstruct:

1. Proto-Hick *su "one" > Early Hick `sin`
   - Possibly with an animate marker *-in
   - Compare other number terms showing final -n

2. Proto-Hick *su-lisu "one-eye/perceiver" > *sulisu > Early Hick `lis` "child"
   - Semantic development: "small one" > "one who perceives/learns" > "child"
   - Matches pattern of perception terms:


```776:786:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
1. Basic Terms
   - his-ʔer [his.ʔer] "to see" < his-ʔer "sight-ACT" → hisʔer
   - lis [lis] "eye" < Proto-Hick \*lisu → lis
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
     See: [Body Parts](#body-parts), [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual)
   - his [his] "sight" < Proto-Hick \*hi-lisu → his
     ([liquid deletion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#sound-changes-in-compounds),
     [vowel coalescence](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
     See: [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual)
   - mulis [mu.lis] "dream, vision" < Proto-Hick \*muruhilisu → mulis
     ([compound reduction](@/languages/hick/early-h
```


This would explain:
1. Why `lis` appears in both perception and kinship terminology
2. The connection between learning/perception and childhood
3. The animate marking pattern seen in other kinship terms
4. The number `sin` "one" having an unusual -n ending compared to other basic numbers

The semantic development follows attested patterns in the language where perception terms often develop extended meanings in kinship and learning contexts.

## User:


[text]  
in is deftinitely not an animate marker... perhaps counting word suffixes?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Ah yes, looking at the number system (lines 577-603), we can see a pattern where basic numbers end in -n:

- sin "one"
- pran "seven" 
- thran "thousand"

So Proto-Hick *su "one" + counting suffix *-in > *suin > sin makes more sense than an animate marker.

This also means we need to revise the etymology of `lis` "child". Looking at the perception terms (lines 776-786) and kinship terms (lines 517-576), we can see:

1. Proto-Hick *lisu "eye" has two developments:
   - Direct: *lisu > lis "eye"
   - With hi- prefix: *hi-lisu > his "sight"

2. The kinship term `lis` "child" likely comes directly from *lisu "eye" with the semantic development:
   - "eye" > "one who sees/perceives" > "learner" > "child"

This better matches:
- The documented sound changes
- The parallel development of perception terms
- The semantic connection between perception and learning
- The number system's use of -n suffixes

The current entry should be revised to remove the incorrect *hi-lisu etymology and animacy prefix reference.

## User:


[text]  
perhaps proto hick had a counting number system that disappeared by early hick


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Yes! Looking at the number system patterns, we could reconstruct Proto-Hick having a distinct counting number system that was lost by Early Hick. The evidence suggests:

1. Proto-Hick had two number forms:
   - Basic: *su "one", *tiru "two", etc.
   - Counting: *suin "one", *tirin "two", etc. (with counting suffix *-in)

2. By Early Hick:
   - Some numbers preserved the counting form (sin, fen, pran)
   - Others preserved the basic form (tir, thal, pil, sek)
   - No functional distinction remained

This explains:
- Why some numbers end in -n while others don't
- The irregular-looking form of sin "one" 
- The pattern in larger numbers (thran "thousand")

We can see this pattern in the number system section:


```577:603:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Number System
   - sek [sek] "six" < Proto-Hick \*seku → sek

   - thran [θran] "thous
```


This reconstruction also helps explain why Early Hick developed new compound numbers like:
- sinkres "nine" (one-eight)
- tirkres "ten" (two-eight)

The loss of the counting/basic number distinction matches other Early Hick simplifications seen in:


```397:404:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
### Number Marking

1. Plural Prefix (ma-)
   - Basic plural marker
   - Examples:
     - mator [ma.tor] "peaks, heights"
     - makel [ma.kel] "skies"
   - Interacts with case marking: ma-tor-el (PL-height-ERG)
```


Where earlier complex systems were reduced to simpler forms.

[text]  
what kind of counting system would most likely fossilize into the basic one


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the number system in Early Hick (lines 580-604 in lexicon.md), and considering the historical development (lines 30-75 in _index.md), I can suggest a plausible Proto-Hick counting system:

Proto-Hick likely had a distinction between:

1. Basic numbers (used in compounds and general reference):
- *su "one"
- *tiru "two"
- *thalu "three"
- *fenu "four"
- *pilu "five"
- *seku "six"
- *pranu "seven"

2. Counting numbers (used in enumeration/counting):
- *suin "one"
- *tirin "two" 
- *thalin "three"
- *fenin "four"
- *pilin "five"
- *sekin "six"
- *pranin "seven"

The -in suffix was likely a specialized counting marker, similar to Japanese つ (-tsu) or Chinese 个 (ge).

This system would naturally fossilize into Early Hick's mixed system where:
1. Some numbers preserved the counting form (sin, fen, pran)
2. Others kept the basic form (tir, thal, pil, sek)

This matches the phonological patterns seen in:

```81:85:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
Proto-Hick, with significant changes occurring mainly in compound formation and
unstressed syllables. See: [Historical Development](#historical-development)
Proto-Hick, with significant changes occurring mainly in compound formation and
## Segmental Inventory

```


And follows similar historical developments shown in:

```32:38:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Early Hick (prehistory to ~300 PF)
## Early Hick (prehistory to ~300 PF)
- Purely oral tradition
- Core maritime and nature vocabulary established
- Complex compound system develops
- Sacred/ritual terminology crystallizes
- Sacred/ritual terminology crystallizes
```


The loss of this distinction fits with Early Hick's general pattern of system simplification seen in:

```47:55:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Late Hick/Early Seneran (105 AI to 400 AI)
## Late Hick/Early Seneran (105 AI to 400 AI)
- Kalassarian settlement period begins
- Administrative terminology adoption
- Initial sound changes:
  - Unstressed vowel reduction begins
  - Compound simplification starts
  - Some liquid deletion word-internally
  - Some liquid deletion word-internally
```


## User:


[text]  
sounds good, so by early hick, the counting numbers also became the general number terms. let's document these in proto-hick, and perhaps update etymology in @lexicon.md and in ontolex-lemon @lexicon.jsonld 


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, let's document this evolution. First, let's add the Proto-Hick counting system to proto-hick.md:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hickic/proto-hick.md
## Proto-Hick Number System

1. Basic Numbers:
   - *su "one"
   - *tiru "two" 
   - *thalu "three"
   - *fenu "four"
   - *pilu "five"
   - *seku "six"
   - *pranu "seven"
   - *kresu "eight"

2. Counting Numbers (with *-in suffix):
   - *suin "one (counting)"
   - *tirin "two (counting)"
   - *thalin "three (counting)"
   - *fenin "four (counting)"
   - *pilin "five (counting)"
   - *sekin "six (counting)"
   - *pranin "seven (counting)"
   - *kresin "eight (counting)"

By Early Hick, this distinction was lost, with some numbers preserving the 
counting form (sin, fen, pran) and others keeping the basic form (tir, thal, 
pil, sek). The counting suffix *-in is preserved in larger numbers like thran 
"thousand".
```

Then update the number etymologies in lexicon.md:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Number System

1. Basic Numbers

   - sin [sin] "one" < Proto-Hick \*suin → sin (counting form)
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - tir [tir] "two" < Proto-Hick \*tiru → tir (basic form)
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - thal [θal] "three" < Proto-Hick \*thalu → thal (basic form)
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - fen [fen] "four" < Proto-Hick \*fenin → fen (counting form)
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
```

And update the JSON-LD (showing just one example entry):

```jsonld:data/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.jsonld
{
  "@id": "eh:sin",
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
  "canonicalForm": {
    "@type": "ontolex:Form",
    "writtenRep": "sin",
    "phoneticRep": "sin"
  },
  "lexicalCategory": "lexinfo:Numeral",
  "etymology": {
    "@type": "etymon:Etymology",
    "etymon:protoform": "Proto-Hick *suin",
    "etymon:note": "From counting form with *-in suffix",
    "etymon:soundChange": "final vowel loss"
  },
  "sense": [
    {
      "@type": "ontolex:LexicalSense", 
      "definition": {
        "@value": "one",
        "@language": "en"
      },
      "lexinfo:semanticField": "Number System"
    }
  ]
}
```

This documents both the Proto-Hick distinction and its simplification in Early Hick, while preserving the etymological information in both the markdown and JSON-LD formats.

## User:

```


Here's the updated proto-hick.md section:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hickic/proto-hick.md
## Proto-Hick Number System

1. Basic Numbers:
   - *su "one"
   - *tiru "two" 
   - *thalu "three"
   - *fenu "four"
   - *pilu "five"
   - *seku "six"
   - *pranu "seven"
   - *kresu "eight"
   - *kethu "hundred"
   - *thranu "thousand"

2. Counting Numbers (with *-inu suffix):
   - *su-inu "one (counting)"
   - *tir-inu "two (counting)"
   - *thal-inu "three (counting)"
   - *fen-inu "four (counting)"
   - *pil-inu "five (counting)"
   - *sek-inu "six (counting)"
   - *pran-inu "seven (counting)"
   - *kres-inu "eight (counting)"
   - *thran-inu "thousand (counting)"

The counting suffix *-inu was used in enumeration contexts, similar to modern 
Japanese つ (-tsu) or Chinese 个 (ge). By Early Hick, this distinction was lost, 
with some numbers preserving the counting form (sin, fen, pran, thran) and others 
keeping the basic form (tir, thal, pil, sek).

Compound numbers developed in Early Hick:
- "nine": *su-inu-kresu > sinkres "one-eight"
- "ten": *tiru-kresu > tirkres "two-eight"
```

Would you like me to proceed with the JSON-LD entries next?

[text]  
ok, now let's update the etymology of lis meaning child


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the lexicon.md entries (lines 777-787), we can see the pattern for perception terms. Let's update the etymology of `lis` "child" to reflect its development from Proto-Hick *lisu "eye".

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
   - lis [lis] "child" < Proto-Hick \*lisu → lis
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
     Note: Semantic development from "eye" > "one who sees/perceives" > "learner" > "child"
     See: [Vision & Perception Terms](#vision--perception-terms), 
     [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual)
```

This etymology:
1. Matches the documented sound changes
2. Follows the pattern of other perception terms (lines 777-787)
3. Aligns with Early Hick's historical development period (lines 32-38)
4. Parallels other semantic extensions in the lexicon (lines 797-811)

Would you like me to update the corresponding JSON-LD entry as well?

## User:


[text]  
it should now be updated to be from 
li-su < Proto-Hick DIM-*su -> lis  


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the lexicon entries (lines 383-399 for face terms, lines 777-787 for perception terms), we should update the etymology of "lis" to reflect its development from the diminutive prefix li- and the basic number *su "one".

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
   - lis [lis] "child" < Proto-Hick \*li-su → lis (lit. "little one")
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
     Note: Semantic development parallels diminutive formations (see lines 627-630)
     See: [Kinship Terms](#kinship-terms), [Diminutive Formation](#augmentativediminutive)
```

This etymology:
1. Follows the documented diminutive pattern (lines 627-630)
2. Uses the basic number *su "one" (lines 581-582)
3. Matches Early Hick's compound formation patterns (lines 618-625)
4. Aligns with other semantic developments in kinship terms (lines 518-575)

Would you like me to update the corresponding JSON-LD entry as well?

## User:

yes please


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



I'll update the JSON-LD entry for "lis" to reflect its etymology from Proto-Hick *li-su. Looking at the prefix structure (lines 667-677) and diminutive formation (lines 379-385), here's the updated entry:

```jsonld:data/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.jsonld
{
  "@id": "eh:lis",
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
  "canonicalForm": {

  },
  "lexicalCategory": "lexinfo:Noun",
  "etymology": {
    "@type": "etymon:Etymology",
    "etymon:protoform": "Proto-Hick *li-su",
    "etymon:note": "From diminutive prefix *li- + *su 'one', lit. 'little one'",
    "etymon:soundChange": "final vowel loss, compound fusion",
    "etymon:morphology": {
      "prefix": "li- (DIM)",
      "root": "*su 'one'"
    }
  },
  "sense": [{
    "@type": "ontolex:LexicalSense",

    "lexinfo:semanticField": "Kinship Terms",
    "usage": "See also: Diminutive Formation, Basic Numbers"
  }]
}
```

This follows the same JSON-LD structure as the number entries while incorporating the morphological information about the diminutive prefix and its combination with the basic number *su "one".

## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

This looks plausible! Let's analyze how it fits with existing patterns:

1. Sound changes match documented patterns:

```32:52:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Pre-Hick Period (before ~600 PF)

While the exact developments remain unclear, comparison of Early Hick forms with
remnant vocabulary suggests several possible sound changes:

1. Final vowels begin devoicing in unstressed syllables
   - \*thralu > [ˈθra.lu̥]
   - \*wardu > [ˈwar.du̥]
   - \*taku > [ˈta.ku̥]

2. Devoiced vowels reduce to schwa
   - [ˈθra.lu̥] > [ˈθra.lə]
   - [ˈwar.du̥] > [ˈwar.də]
   - [ˈta.ku̥] > [ˈta.kə]

## Early Hick (~600 PF onward)

1. Final schwa deletion
   - [ˈθra.lə] > [ˈθral]
   - [ˈwar.də] > [ˈward]
   - [ˈta.kə] > [ˈtak]
```


2. The augmentative tor- follows the pattern shown in:

```420:426:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
2. Augmentative (tor-)
   - Prefix meaning "great, mighty" (from "height, peak")
   - Examples:
     - tornes [tor.nes] "great fish, whale"
     - topel [to.pel] "great bear" (tor-pel → topel, liquid deletion)
     - tomal [to.mal] "great pool, lake" (tor-mal → tomal, liquid deletion)
3. Speed Augmentative (tor- -sim)
```


3. The hi- prefix pattern matches:

```76:82:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
- his [his] "sight" < Proto-Hick \*hi-lisu → his
  ([liquid deletion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#sound-changes-in-compounds),
  [vowel coalescence](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  See: [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual)
- hilis [hi.lis] "to see (animate)" < Proto-Hick \*hi-lisu → hilis
  ([animacy prefix](@/languages/hickic/proto-hick.md#animacy-marking))
- mulis [mu.lis] "dream, vision" < Proto-Hick \*muruhilisu → mulis
```


Let's add these entries to lexicon.md:

```markdown
### Basic Terms
- tor [tor] "great, mighty" < Proto-Hick *storu → tor
  ([initial sibilant loss, final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick))
  Note: Original sense "grow" preserved in augmentative usage
  See: [Augmentative Formation](#augmentativediminutive)

- istor [is.tor] "growth (living)" < Proto-Hick *hi-storu → istor
  ([initial sibilant loss, final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick))
  See: [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual)

### Conjunctions
- ru [ru] "and" < Proto-Hick *storu → ru
  Note: Grammaticalized from "grow" sense through semantic bleaching
  See: [Basic Terms](#basic-terms)
```

This reconstruction explains:
1. The augmentative prefix's origin
2. The connection between growth and sacred terms
3. The preservation of a rare CV syllable in ru
4. The development of conjunctions from content words

Would you like me to create the corresponding JSON-LD entries as well?

[text]  
just to note, tor meaning mountain comes from the root toru, and as of now, is not known to be cognate with stor derived words


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Ah, I apologize for conflating those etymologies. You're right - looking at the lexicon entries:


```194:196:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
- thalgral [θal.gral] "hillside" < thal-gral "side-earth" → thalgral
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
```


We can see that `tor` "height, peak" has its own etymology from Proto-Hick *toru.

Let me revise the entries to keep these distinct:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Basic Terms

- tor [tor] "height, peak" < Proto-Hick *toru → tor
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  See: [Augmentative Prefix](#augmentativediminutive)

- istor [is.tor] "growth (living)" < Proto-Hick *hi-storu → istor
  ([initial sibilant loss, final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick))
  See: [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual)

### Conjunctions

- ru [ru] "and" < Proto-Hick *storu → ru
  Note: Grammaticalized from "grow" sense through semantic bleaching
  See: [Basic Terms](#basic-terms)
```

This maintains the separate etymologies:
1. *toru "height, peak" > tor 
2. *storu "grow" > istor (with hi- prefix), ru (through grammaticalization)

Would you like me to update the JSON-LD entries to reflect this correction as well?

## User:


[text]  
this is incorrect. there is a separate lexeme


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Ah, you're right. Looking at the lexicon entries, I can see that there are two distinct lexemes:


```194:196:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
- thalgral [θal.gral] "hillside" < thal-gral "side-earth" → thalgral
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-formation))
```

Shows `tor` "height, peak" < Proto-Hick *toru

And separately, we should add the new entries for the *storu root:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Basic Terms

- stor [stor] "grow" < Proto-Hick *storu → stor
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick))
  See: [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual)

- istor [is.tor] "growth (living)" < Proto-Hick *hi-storu → istor
  ([initial sibilant loss, final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick))
  See: [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual)

### Conjunctions

- ru [ru] "and" < Proto-Hick *storu → ru
  Note: Grammaticalized from "grow" sense through semantic bleaching
  See: [Basic Terms](#basic-terms)
```

Would you like me to create the JSON-LD entries for these new lexemes as well?

## User:

yes plese


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Looking at the lexicon entries, I'll update the entries for the *storu root and its derivatives. The pattern follows other basic terms (lines 37-51) and compounds (lines 662-672).

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Basic Terms

- stor [stor] "grow" < Proto-Hick *storu → stor
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick))
  Note: Forms augmentative prefix tor- through initial s-loss
  See: [Augmentative Formation](#augmentativediminutive)

- istor [is.tor] "growth (living)" < Proto-Hick *hi-storu → istor
  ([initial sibilant loss, final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick))
  Note: Preserves animate prefix hi- 
  See: [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual)

### Conjunctions

- ru [ru] "and" < Proto-Hick *storu → ru
  Note: Grammaticalized from "grow" through semantic bleaching and phonological reduction
  See: [Basic Terms](#basic-terms)
```

Would you like me to create the corresponding JSON-LD entries for these terms as well?

@Lexurgy how would I do a cleanup of illegal consonant clusters


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the Lexurgy documentation and Early Hick's phonotactics (lines 137-159), we need to handle illegal consonant clusters. Here's how we could write cleanup rules:

```lexurgy
# Define legal initial clusters
Class initial-clusters {br, dr, tr, kr, fl, pl, kl, θr}
Class sacred-initials {θr}
Class archaic-initials {gn, kn}

# Define legal final clusters  
Class final-clusters {st, sk, sp, ks, ls, rs}

# Cleanup rules for illegal clusters
cleanup:
    # Insert schwa between illegal consonant sequences
    {consonant} => ə / _ {consonant} // @initial-clusters, @final-clusters

    # Special handling for sacred terms - preserve θr
    {consonant} => ə / θ _ // r

    # Handle triple consonants
    {consonant} => ə / {consonant} _ {consonant}

    # Clean up any remaining illegal clusters
    {consonant} => * / _ {consonant} // @initial-clusters, @final-clusters
```

This ruleset:
1. Defines the legal clusters based on Early Hick phonotactics
2. Inserts schwa between illegal consonant sequences
3. Preserves sacred initial θr
4. Handles triple consonants by inserting schwa
5. As a fallback, deletes consonants in illegal clusters

The rules follow the documented patterns for:
- Initial clusters (lines 147-151)
- Final clusters (lines 155-158) 
- Sacred terms preservation (line 150)

Would you like me to add any additional rules or explain how specific cases would be handled?

## User:


[text]  
the syntax looks incorrect...


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

You're right, I apologize for the syntax issues. Looking at the phonotactic constraints (lines 137-159 in _index.md), here's the corrected Lexurgy cleanup rules:

```lexurgy
# Legal clusters
Class initial {br, dr, tr, kr, fl, pl, kl, θr, gn, kn}
Class final {st, sk, sp, ks, ls, rs}

# Cleanup rules
cleanup:
    # Insert schwa between illegal consonant sequences
    {C} => ə / _ {C} // @initial, @final

    # Handle triple consonants
    {C} => ə / {C} _ {C}

    # Clean up remaining illegal clusters by deletion
    {C} => * / _ {C} // @initial, @final
```

This follows Lexurgy's syntax for:
- Class definitions for legal clusters
- Conditional rules with // for exceptions
- Environment specifications with _
- Schwa insertion and consonant deletion

Would you like me to explain how specific cases would be handled by these rules?
