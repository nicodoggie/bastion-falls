we have languages that don't have true verbs, but form verbs from affixing onto nominal forms, right?


## AI (gpt-4o):

Yes, that's correct! Some languages use a process called *verbalization*, where verbs are formed by adding affixes to nominal forms. This is common in languages with rich morphological systems. For example, in some Native American languages, nouns can be transformed into verbs by adding specific prefixes or suffixes. This process allows speakers to convey actions or states derived from the noun's meaning.

If you're interested in a specific language or want to know more about how this process works in a particular linguistic context, feel free to ask!

great, now do these languages have a means to nominalize a verbalized word? say a word tir means sour, tir'er means to ferment from -'er as a verbalizer. 

now we want to say something like "fermented fish" would a similarity prefix ka- be enough to make it an adjectival form so we can say "katir'er nes"


## AI (gpt-4o):

Yes, many languages that form verbs from nouns also have ways to nominalize or adjectivize those verbs. The process you described, using a prefix like *ka-* to create an adjectival form, is a plausible linguistic strategy. 

In your example, if *tir* means "sour" and *tir'er* means "to ferment," then using *ka-* to form *katir'er* could indeed work as an adjectival form meaning "fermented." This would allow you to say "katir'er nes" for "fermented fish."

Languages often have specific morphological rules for these transformations, so the exact method can vary. Some languages might use different affixes or even reduplication to achieve similar results. If you have a specific language in mind, I could provide more detailed information on its morphological processes.

now the word tir'er also is used as a word for to wince. is it naturalistic to have this pair of senses? 

I'm thinking, to specify the process of fermentation , it may take the translative -sim 


## AI (gpt-4o):



It's quite naturalistic for a word to have multiple, seemingly unrelated senses, especially in languages with rich morphological systems. This phenomenon is known as *polysemy*. The context in which the word is used often helps disambiguate the meaning. 

In your example, *tir'er* having the senses "to ferment" and "to wince" could be plausible, especially if there's a cultural or metaphorical link between the two actions. For instance, the act of wincing might metaphorically relate to the sourness or sharpness associated with fermentation.

Using a translative suffix like *-sim* to specify the process of fermentation is a reasonable approach. It would help clarify the intended meaning when the context alone isn't enough. So, you might have *tir'ersim* to specifically denote "the process of fermentation," distinguishing it from the act of wincing. 

This kind of linguistic flexibility is common and can add depth to a language's expressive capabilities.

I suppose if context is enough tir'er could be fine to mean to ferment


## AI (gpt-4o):



Absolutely, context often plays a crucial role in determining the meaning of polysemous words. In many languages, speakers rely on the surrounding words, the situation, or even cultural knowledge to infer the correct sense of a word like *tir'er*. 

For instance, if you're discussing food preparation, *tir'er* would likely be understood as "to ferment." Conversely, in a context involving physical reactions or emotions, it might be interpreted as "to wince." 

This reliance on context is a natural part of language use and allows for efficient communication without needing a separate word for every possible meaning.

especially since the translative would usually take an intransitive verb to be transitive, with the ergative being the previous state and the absolutive being the transformed state


## AI (gpt-4o):



Yes, that's a fascinating aspect of languages with ergative-absolutive alignment. In such languages, the translative case or similar morphological markers can indeed be used to indicate a change of state, often making an intransitive verb transitive. 

In your example, if *tir'er* is intransitive, meaning "to ferment" or "to wince," applying a translative suffix like *-sim* could transform it into a transitive verb. Here, the ergative case would mark the initial state or agent causing the change, while the absolutive case would mark the resulting state or the entity being transformed.

This kind of linguistic structure allows for nuanced expression of changes and processes, highlighting the dynamic nature of language. If you have more specific examples or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

[text]  
in cases where the translative both uses the ergative argument as either the agent of change or the initial state, what mechanisms are used to disambiguate?


## AI (gpt-4o):





In languages where the translative case can use the ergative argument as either the agent of change or the initial state, several mechanisms might be employed to disambiguate these roles:

1. **Contextual Clues**: Often, the surrounding context provides enough information to determine whether the ergative argument is the agent or the initial state. This is similar to how polysemy is resolved in many languages.

2. **Additional Morphological Markers**: Some languages might use additional affixes or particles to clarify the role of the ergative argument. For example, a specific prefix or suffix could indicate agency, while another might denote the initial state.

3. **Word Order**: In some languages, the position of words in a sentence can help clarify roles. For instance, placing the agent closer to the verb might indicate agency, while a different position might suggest an initial state.

4. **Auxiliary Verbs or Particles**: The use of auxiliary verbs or particles can also help specify the role of the ergative argument. These might function similarly to how auxiliary verbs in English can indicate tense or aspect.

5. **Semantic Cues**: The inherent meaning of the words involved can sometimes make one interpretation more plausible than the other. For example, certain verbs might more naturally align with one role over the other.

These mechanisms can vary widely between languages, reflecting the diversity and adaptability of human language. If you have a specific language or example in mind, I could provide more tailored insights!
