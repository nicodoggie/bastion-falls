based on early hick's Sound inventory @early-hick can you generate a list of 50 words. don't attempt to add meaning to them, simply generate a comma delimited list. first column would be a phonemic transcription, second column would be an IPA formatted phonological transcription


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

I'll reference the sound inventory from:

```87:111:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
## Modern Seneran (900 AI to present)
```


Here's a list of 50 phonologically possible Early Hick words, formatted as 
phonemic/IPA pairs:

```plaintext
bel/[bel], thur/[θur], kran/[kran], mur/[mur], pal/[pal], 
fen/[fen], dak/[dak], thil/[θil], gur/[gur], nis/[nis],
pran/[pran], keth/[keθ], mal/[mal], fir/[fir], thal/[θal],
brak/[brak], wen/[wen], dur/[dur], thes/[θes], kin/[kin],
plak/[plak], mer/[mer], fal/[fal], thun/[θun], gis/[gis],
klar/[klar], din/[din], thak/[θak], bur/[bur], pes/[pes],
tran/[tran], mel/[mel], fek/[fek], thir/[θir], gan/[gan],
bris/[bris], wer/[wer], dun/[dun], thel/[θel], kar/[kar],
flan/[flan], min/[min], thak/[θak], pul/[pul], ges/[ges],
kral/[kral], dan/[dan], thes/[θes], bim/[bim], wak/[wak]
```

These words follow Early Hick's phonotactic constraints:
- Simple syllable structure (CVC)
- Permitted initial clusters (br-, dr-, tr-, kr-, fl-, pl-, kl-)
- Allowed consonants (p, b, t, d, k, g, f, θ, s, m, n, l, r, ')
- Core vowels (i, e, a, o, u)

With context, the word itself would be enough to mean the color, however to
disambiguate from other meanings, the
[Similarity Prefix](@/languages/hick/early-hick#similarity-marking) _ka-_ is
used.

Some color terms do not have other semantic categories, for example 'gra' lost
other meanings by Early Hick, this _ka-_ is unnecessary.

## User:


[text]  
can you also generate a similar list from @proto-hick.md please?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

I'll analyze the Proto-Hick reconstructed forms from:


```19:45:site/content/languages/hick/proto-hick.md
Proto-Hick shows a simpler phonological system than Early Hick, with strict
(C)CV(C) syllable structure and obligatory onsets (filled by glottal stop if no
other consonant).

### Colors

With context, the word itself would be enough to mean the color, however to
disambiguate from other meanings, the
[Similarity Prefix](@/languages/hick/early-hick#similarity-marking) _ka-_ is
used.

Some color terms do not have other semantic categories, for example 'gra' lost
other meanings by Early Hick, this _ka-_ is unnecessary.

I referenced these sections to ensure compliance with Proto-Hick phonology and to 
filter against existing lexicon:


```19:45:site/content/languages/hick/proto-hick.md
Proto-Hick shows a simpler phonological system than Early Hick, with strict
(C)CV(C) syllable structure and obligatory onsets (filled by glottal stop if no
other consonant).
