what grammatical case is japanese -mashou? such as tabemashou "let's eat"?


## AI (gpt-4o):

In Japanese, the suffix "-mashou" (as in "tabemashou" meaning "let's eat") is not associated with a grammatical case in the way that cases are used in languages like Latin or Russian. Instead, "-mashou" is a verb conjugation that expresses a volitional or suggestive mood. It is used to indicate a suggestion or proposal, often translated as "let's" in English. This form is part of the polite verb conjugation system in Japanese, which is used to make polite suggestions or invitations.

are there grammatical cases with the same function?


## AI (gpt-4o):

Grammatical cases typically indicate the role of a noun or pronoun in a sentence, such as subject, object, or possession, rather than expressing moods or suggestions. However, some languages have specific verb forms or moods that serve similar functions to the Japanese "-mashou."

For example, in English, the imperative mood can sometimes be used to make suggestions, though it is more direct and often used for commands. In some Slavic languages, like Russian, there is an imperative mood that can be used to suggest actions, but it is not a case.

In summary, while grammatical cases themselves don't typically express suggestions or proposals, many languages have verb forms or moods that serve this purpose.

I mean, in the case of a language with no true nouns, but are conjugated with "cases" to perform a grammatical function. could those not be considered cases?


## AI (gpt-4o):

Ah, I see what you're getting at. In languages where the distinction between nouns and verbs is less clear, or where words are inflected to perform various grammatical functions, the concept of "cases" can be more fluid.

In such languages, what might traditionally be considered verb conjugations could indeed function similarly to cases, in that they modify the word to express different grammatical roles or functions. These could include indicating mood, aspect, or even what would traditionally be considered case roles in other languages.

For instance, in some polysynthetic languages, a single word can incorporate what would be entire sentences in other languages, with affixes indicating subject, object, tense, mood, and more. In these contexts, the boundaries between what is a "case" and what is a "conjugation" can blur, and the terminology might be adapted to fit the unique grammatical structure of the language.

So, while not cases in the traditional sense, these inflections could be seen as serving similar grammatical functions, depending on the language's structure.

yes so how would one categorize something similar to japanese mashou?


## AI (gpt-4o):



In the context of Japanese, "-mashou" is best categorized as a verb conjugation that expresses a volitional or suggestive mood. It is part of the broader system of Japanese verb conjugations that modify the verb to express different nuances of meaning, such as politeness, intention, or suggestion.

In languages with similar structures, where verbs are inflected to express what might be considered "cases" in other languages, "-mashou" would still likely be categorized under mood or modality. This is because it modifies the verb to express the speaker's intention or suggestion, rather than indicating a grammatical role like subject or object.

So, in summary, "-mashou" is a mood or modality marker, specifically indicating a volitional or suggestive mood, rather than a grammatical case.

so we can say we can encode volition using a -mashou suffix on a verbalized nominal word?


## AI (gpt-4o):



Yes, that's a good way to put it. In Japanese, the "-mashou" suffix is used to encode volition or suggestion on a verb. If you have a nominal word that can be verbalized, adding "-mashou" would suggest an action related to that noun, in a volitional or suggestive manner.

For example, if you take a nominal concept and verbalize it, you can then apply "-mashou" to suggest doing something related to that concept. This is a common way to express "let's [do something]" in Japanese, effectively encoding the speaker's volition or suggestion into the verb form.

so say in @early-hick . we can have -arm to indicate a volitional mood?


## AI (gpt-4o):

In Early Hick, the concept of a volitional mood could be expressed through a specific suffix like "-arm" if it were part of the language's morphological system. However, based on the provided code snippets, Early Hick does not explicitly mention a volitional mood suffix like "-arm."

The language does have a rich system of verb formation and case marking, as seen with the verbalizer suffix "-'er" for creating verbs from nouns and property concepts. If you wanted to introduce a volitional mood, you could theoretically propose a suffix like "-arm" to indicate volition, similar to how "-mashou" functions in Japanese.

To implement this, you would need to define the suffix within the language's morphological rules, ensuring it fits within the existing structure of prefixes and suffixes. This would involve specifying its position in the affix order and any phonological interactions it might have with other morphemes.

For example, you might define it as follows:

```markdown
### Volitional Mood Suffix

- -arm [arm]: indicates volitional mood, suggesting intention or willingness to perform an action.

#### Usage Example

- ven-arm [ven.arm] "intend to carry" < ven-arm "yoke-VOLITION" → venarm
```

This is a hypothetical addition and would need to be integrated into the language's existing grammatical framework.

not yet. say we have sinasarm, where arm replaces the 'er to mean a verbal-volitional marker, we can have 

sinasarm!
let's play!


## AI (gpt-4o):

In the context of Early Hick, if you want to introduce a suffix like "-arm" to indicate a volitional mood, you could indeed replace the verbalizer "-'er" with "-arm" to express volition or intention. This would be similar to how "-mashou" functions in Japanese.

For example, using "sinas" (meaning "drift, passage") from the lexicon, you could form "sinasarm" to mean "let's drift" or "let's play," depending on the context.

Here's how you might document this in the lexicon:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Volitional Mood Suffix

- -arm [arm]: indicates volitional mood, suggesting intention or willingness to perform an action.

#### Usage Example

- sinasarm [si.nas.arm] "let's drift/play" < sinas-arm "drift-VOLITION" → sinasarm
```

This addition would need to be integrated into the language's existing grammatical framework, ensuring it fits within the morphological rules and phonological constraints of Early Hick.

let's add -arm in the @_index.md documentation in the verbal morphology section as a volitional marker


## AI (gpt-4o):

To add the "-arm" suffix as a volitional marker in the Early Hick documentation, you can include it in the verbal morphology section of the `_index.md` file. Here's how you might document this addition:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Verbal Morphology

Early Hick verbs are formed from nouns and property concepts using the verbalizer affix _-'er_. To express volition or intention, the suffix _-arm_ can be used, replacing _-'er_.

### Volitional Marker

- **-arm**: Indicates volitional mood, suggesting intention or willingness to perform an action.

#### Usage Example

- **sinasarm**: "let's play" or "let's drift" < sinas-arm "play-VOLITION" → sinasarm

This suffix allows speakers to express a desire or suggestion to perform an action, similar to the volitional mood in other languages.
```

This addition should be placed in the section where verbal morphology is discussed, ensuring it fits within the existing structure and conventions of the language documentation.
