so the shipyards all have inns and taverns attached to them as well?


## AI (gpt-4o):

Not exactly. The shipyards themselves don't have inns and taverns directly attached to them, but the nearby districts in Port Surrey do feature a variety of inns and taverns that cater to the people working in or visiting the shipyards. These establishments are strategically located to serve the needs of sailors, merchants, and travelers who frequent the area.

For example, in the **Admiralty Dockyards District**, you have places like **The Sailor's Haven** and **The Anchor's Hold**, which are popular among naval personnel and visiting officers. These establishments are conveniently located near the naval facilities, providing a place for relaxation and lodging.

Similarly, in the **Port Surrey District (Central)**, you have **The Honest Toil Tavern** and **The Tidebinder's Retreat**, which cater to the commercial and affluent clientele, respectively. These are positioned to serve those involved in the bustling marketplace and shipbuilding activities.

So, while the shipyards themselves are focused on shipbuilding and repair, the surrounding districts offer a range of accommodations and social venues to support the people connected to these industries.

You're right, and I apologize for the oversight. Let's rename the taverns and inns to avoid confusion with the shipyards. Here's an updated list with new names:
