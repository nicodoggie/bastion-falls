@early-hick I want to make a sentence that means
"my gut is tickled in infatuation with that radiant girl"
but I don't have complex clauses yet.

pakupak'er dakisaes 'alisel
tickle.VERB infatuation.ABS person.DEM.PROX.ANIM.ERG

kathrakel'er liwentanes
SIM.sun DIM.wen.DEM.VISIBLE.PROX.ANIM.ABS


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Let me help analyze and correct this sentence construction based on the Early Hick lexicon and grammar.

From the lexicon and grammar files, I can see several relevant entries:


```169:173:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
- dakisa [da.ki.sa] "infatuation" < Proto-Hick \*daluku-isa-hihasa → dakisa
  ([liquid deletion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#sound-changes-in-compounds))
  ([compound reduction](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-simplification))
  Note: Literally "snake in the gut"; metaphorical extension for intense desire
  See: [Body Terms](#bodily-functions--states), [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual)
```

Shows "dakisa" means "infatuation" (literally "snake in the gut")


```766:769:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
- pakupak [ˈpa.ku.pək] "tickle" < Proto-Hick \*pakupaku → pakupak
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Preserves onomatopoeic reduplication, shows unstressed vowel reduction
  See: [Basic Terms](#basic-terms)
```

Shows "pakupak" means "tickle" with reduplication

Based on the grammar:

````494:505:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md

### Verbalizer

- -'er ['er]: creates verbs from nouns and property concepts (See:
  [Proto-Hick](@/languages/hick/proto-hick.md#segmental-inventory))
- If -'er is preceded by a plosive, it surfaces as [er]

```plaintext
mulis-'er [mulis.ʔer] "dreaminɡ"
tak-er [tak.er] "strike"
```

````

Shows how the verbalizer -'er works

Here's a more grammatically correct version:

```plaintext
dakisa-es pakupak-'er wen'al-thir-el
infatuation-ABS tickle-VERB woman-KNOWN.ANIM-ERG

"The known woman tickles (me) with infatuation"
```

Key corrections:
1. The absolutive case (-es) marks the patient "infatuation"
2. The ergative (-el) marks the agent "woman"
3. Used wen'al "woman" from the lexicon rather than a demonstrative
4. The -thir suffix indicates "known/visible animate"
5. The verbalizer -'er creates the verb "tickle"

Note: Early Hick doesn't have a way to directly express "radiant" or "my gut", as these would require more complex clausal structures. The language tends toward simpler, more direct expressions.

liwen would be a girl from DIM.wen'al 


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, I can help construct this sentence more accurately. Let me analyze the relevant parts:


```857:859:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
- gal [gal] "man" < karal + ʔalu
- wen'al [wen.ʔal] "woman" < wen-'al "flower person" → wen'al
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
```

Shows wen'al means "woman" (literally "flower person")


```412:419:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
1. Diminutive (li-)

   - Prefix meaning "small, lesser"
   - Examples:
     - limal [li.mal] "small pool, pond"
     - liren [li.ren] "small deer, fawn"
     - lines [li.nes] "small fish, minnow"

```

Shows li- is the diminutive prefix meaning "small, lesser"

So liwen'al would indeed be "girl" (literally "small woman/flower-person")

Here's a more grammatically correct version of your sentence:

```plaintext
dakisa-es pakupak-'er liwen'al-thir-el
infatuation-ABS tickle-VERB DIM.woman-KNOWN.ANIM-ERG

"The known girl tickles (me) with infatuation"
```

Key points:
1. liwen'al is correctly formed from li- + wen'al
2. -thir suffix marks "known animate"
3. -el marks the ergative case (agent)
4. -es marks the absolutive case (patient)
5. -'er is the verbalizer

The sentence follows Early Hick's ergative-absolutive alignment and maintains proper case marking while expressing the metaphorical concept of infatuation (dakisa) as the patient of the action.

## User:


[text]  
so just an implied first person? what if I want to have an explicit reference to me. how do you suggest we can extend the languages to have that construction


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the grammar documentation, Early Hick doesn't have explicit personal pronouns. Let me analyze the relevant sections:


```471:476:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
### Personal Reference

1. Spatial Demonstratives
   - istal "this.place-person" (speaker's location)
   - etal "that.place-person" (addressee's location)
   - utal "far.place-person" (third party location)
```


Shows the only personal reference system uses spatial demonstratives (istal, etal, utal).

To add explicit first person reference, we could extend the language naturally by:

1. Using the existing spatial demonstrative system:
```plaintext
istal-el dakisa-es pakupak-'er liwen'al-thir-el
this.place.person-ERG infatuation-ABS tickle-VERB DIM.woman-KNOWN.ANIM-ERG

"I am tickled with infatuation by the known girl"
```

2. Creating a new pronoun system based on Early Hick's patterns:
- Could derive from 'al "person" + -is "proximate animate"
- Would follow ergative-absolutive alignment
- Example construction:
```plaintext
'alis-el (1st person ERG)
'alis-es (1st person ABS)
```

This would be consistent with:
- The language's demonstrative system
- Its ergative-absolutive alignment
- The existing compound formation rules
- The animacy marking patterns

The first option (using istal) is more historically authentic since it uses 
attested forms. The second option would be a reasonable extension following the 
language's internal logic.

Which approach would you prefer to explore further?

## User:


[text]  
that's why I had "'al'is" this person 


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Ah yes! Looking at the interrogatives section:


```871:879:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md

1. Basic Forms

   - 'aka [ʔa.ka] "what" (basic question root)
   - 'alis [ʔa.lis] < 'aka-'al-is "who" (what-person-PROX.ANIM)
   - 'atal [ʔa.tal] < 'aka-tal-is "where" (what-place-PROX.INAN)
   - 'atel [ʔa.tel] < 'aka-tel-is "when" (what-time-PROX.INAN)
   - 'aker [ʔa.ker] < 'aka-'er-is "how" (what-VERB-PROX.INAN)

```


Shows that 'alis is derived from 'aka-'al-is meaning "who" (what-person-PROX.ANIM)

And looking at the personal reference system:


```471:476:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
### Personal Reference

1. Spatial Demonstratives
   - istal "this.place-person" (speaker's location)
   - etal "that.place-person" (addressee's location)
   - utal "far.place-person" (third party location)
```


Shows the spatial demonstrative system for person reference.

So we could indeed use 'alis for first person reference! Here's the corrected sentence:

```plaintext
'alis-es dakisa-es pakupak-'er liwen'al-thir-el
1P-ABS infatuation-ABS tickle-VERB DIM.woman-KNOWN.ANIM-ERG

"The known girl tickles me with infatuation"
```

Key points:
1. 'alis takes absolutive (-es) as it's the patient
2. dakisa takes absolutive (-es) as it's also a patient
3. liwen'al takes ergative (-el) as it's the agent
4. -thir marks "known animate"
5. The verb pakupak-'er takes two absolutive arguments

This is a more authentic way to express first person using Early Hick's attested forms!

## User:


[text]  
no no, that is an interrogative. 'al'is is literally person.DEM.PROX.ANIM


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Ah, you're right! Looking at the demonstrative system:


```459:469:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
1. Visible/Known
   - -is [is] "this" (inanimate)
   - -ʔis [ʔis] "this" (animate)
   - -en [en] "that" (inanimate)
   - -tan [tan] "that" (animate)
2. Hidden but Sensed
   - -eth [eθ] "this/that" (inanimate)
   - -thir [θir] "this/that" (animate)
3. Distant/Out of Sight
   - -um [um] "that" (inanimate)
   - -rum [rum] "that" (animate)
```


Shows that 'al (person) + -is (PROX.ANIM) would indeed create 'al'is meaning "this person" or "I".

So your original sentence structure was on the right track. Here's the corrected version:

```plaintext
'al'is-es dakisa-es pakupak-'er liwen'al-thir-el
person.PROX.ANIM-ABS infatuation-ABS tickle-VERB DIM.woman-KNOWN.ANIM-ERG

"I am tickled with infatuation by the known girl"
```

Key points:
1. 'al'is = 'al (person) + -is (PROX.ANIM) = "this person/I"
2. Takes absolutive (-es) as it's the patient
3. dakisa takes absolutive (-es) as it's also a patient
4. liwen'al takes ergative (-el) as it's the agent
5. -thir marks "known animate"

This is a more accurate use of the demonstrative system for first-person reference!

## User:


[text]  
the person is with infatuation, so maybe
'al'ises dakisaeses pakupak'er kathrakel liwen'alel 
person.PROX.ANIM.ABS infatuation.ELL.ABS tickle.VERB SIM.sun girl.ERG


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Let me analyze this construction by checking the relevant grammar sections:


```557:564:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
1. Basic Spatial Cases

   - -aes (ILL): "inward, into"
   - -imris (ELL): "outward, from"
   - -itar (SUPE): "upward, upon"
   - -asam (SUBE): "downward, onto"
   - -esp (SUB): "under, below"

```

Shows the spatial cases, including -aes (ILL) for "inward, into" and -imris (ELL) for "outward, from"


```439:447:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
### Similarity Marking

1. Similarity Prefix (ka-)
   - Prefix meaning "like, similar to"
   - Always surfaces as [kə-] due to regular vowel reduction
   - Examples:
     - ka-tor [kə.tor] "hill-like" (smaller than a mountain)
     - ka-mal [kə.mal] "pond-like" (smaller than a lake)
     - ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)
```

Shows ka- (similarity prefix) becoming [kə-] due to vowel reduction

Your sentence structure is close, but needs some adjustments:

```plaintext
'al'is-es dakisa-imris pakupak-'er liwen'al-thir-el
person.PROX.ANIM-ABS infatuation-ELL tickle-VERB girl-KNOWN.ANIM-ERG

"The known girl tickles this person with (lit: from) infatuation"
```

Key corrections:
1. Use -imris (ELL) instead of -aes-es (double absolutive isn't allowed)
2. kathrakel should be kəthral (ka- reduces to [kə-])
3. Added -thir for "known animate" since we're referring to a specific girl
4. Removed redundant absolutive marking on dakisa since -imris is a spatial case

The ellative case (-imris) here indicates the infatuation as the source/cause of 
the tickling, which fits the metaphorical meaning better than the illative (-aes).

Would you like me to explain any of these grammatical points in more detail?

## User:


[text]  
it's not a double absolutive tho


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

You're right - looking at the case system:


```557:564:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
1. Basic Spatial Cases

   - -aes (ILL): "inward, into"
   - -imris (ELL): "outward, from"
   - -itar (SUPE): "upward, upon"
   - -asam (SUBE): "downward, onto"
   - -esp (SUB): "under, below"

```


Shows the spatial cases, including -imris (ELL) for "outward, from" which would be more appropriate for expressing "with" in this context.

So the corrected sentence should be:

```plaintext
'al'is-es dakisa-imris pakupak-'er liwen'al-thir-el
person.PROX.ANIM-ABS infatuation-ELL tickle-VERB girl-KNOWN.ANIM-ERG

"The known girl tickles this person with (lit: from) infatuation"
```

Key points:
1. 'al'is-es takes absolutive as patient
2. dakisa takes ellative (-imris) to mark "with/from"
3. liwen'al takes ergative (-el) as agent
4. -thir marks "known animate"

This follows the ergative-absolutive alignment properly while using the spatial 
case system to express the instrumental/manner meaning.

## User:


[text]  
kathakel would not reduce because of morpheme boundaries in the present languages, hadn't undergone sound changes yet


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Ah yes, looking at the compound phonology rules:


```219:235:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
### Sound Changes in Compounds

1. Liquid Deletion

   - tor-mal → tomal "lake"
   - val-mal → vamal "spirit pool"
   - thral-gral → thragral "sacred earth"

2. Nasal Deletion

   - bram-mal → bramal "tidal pool"
   - bran-kel → brakel "morning sky"

3. Vowel Coalescence
   - kei-aes → kees "sky flow"
   - thrai-aes → thraes "sacred flow"

```


Shows that liquid deletion and nasal deletion occur in compounds, but ka- as a prefix maintains morpheme boundaries:


```439:447:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
### Similarity Marking

1. Similarity Prefix (ka-)
   - Prefix meaning "like, similar to"
   - Always surfaces as [kə-] due to regular vowel reduction
   - Examples:
     - ka-tor [kə.tor] "hill-like" (smaller than a mountain)
     - ka-mal [kə.mal] "pond-like" (smaller than a lake)
     - ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)
```


Shows that ka- (similarity prefix) always reduces to [kə-] due to vowel reduction, but maintains its morpheme boundary.

So you're right - it would be:

```plaintext
'al'is-es dakisa-aes pakupak-'er ka-thrakel liwen'al-thir-el
person.PROX.ANIM-ABS infatuation-ILL tickle-VERB SIM.sun girl-KNOWN.ANIM-ERG

"The known girl tickles this person into infatuation"
```

Key points:
1. ka-thrakel maintains morpheme boundary (no liquid deletion)
2. ka- reduces to [kə-] due to vowel reduction
3. -aes (illative) marks movement into a state
4. Maintains proper ergative-absolutive alignment

This follows both the morphophonological rules and case system of Early Hick more accurately!

## User:


[text]  
what's with the thirel? why hidder but not sensed? instead lf tan, visible animate "that"?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the demonstrative system:


```459:469:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
1. Visible/Known
   - -is [is] "this" (inanimate)
   - -ʔis [ʔis] "this" (animate)
   - -en [en] "that" (inanimate)
   - -tan [tan] "that" (animate)
2. Hidden but Sensed
   - -eth [eθ] "this/that" (inanimate)
   - -thir [θir] "this/that" (animate)
3. Distant/Out of Sight
   - -um [um] "that" (inanimate)
   - -rum [rum] "that" (animate)
```


You're right! For a visible animate referent, we should use -tan "that (animate)" rather than -thir which is for "hidden but sensed".

So the sentence should be:

```plaintext
'al'is-es dakisa-aes pakupak-'er liwen'al-tan-el
person.PROX.ANIM-ABS infatuation-ILL tickle-VERB DIM.woman-VISIBLE.ANIM-ERG

"That visible girl tickles this person into infatuation"
```

The -tan suffix is more appropriate here since:
1. We're talking about a visible girl
2. -tan specifically marks visible animate referents
3. -thir would imply we can only sense but not see her
4. It maintains the proper distinction in the demonstrative system between visible (-tan) and sensed (-thir) animate referents

Thank you for catching this error in the demonstrative marking!
