are there any more missing linguistic categories?


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):

Looking at the current documentation, here are some important linguistic categories that could be added to make the Early Hick description more complete:

1. **Aspect and Tense System**
   - How temporal relations are marked
   - Whether it's aspect-prominent or tense-prominent
   - Any tense/aspect markers and their usage

2. **Voice System**
   - While ergative-absolutive alignment is mentioned, specific voice markers
   - Passive/antipassive constructions
   - Middle voice if present

3. **Evidentiality**
   - Given it's a maritime/religious language, might have markers for:
   - Direct observation
   - Hearsay
   - Inference
   - Traditional knowledge

4. **Modality**
   - Epistemic modality (certainty/possibility)
   - Deontic modality (obligation/permission)
   - Modal particles or affixes

5. **Information Structure**
   - Topic/focus marking
   - Word order variations
   - Discourse particles

6. **Honorifics/Register**
   - Given the religious aspects, might have:
   - Sacred vs profane registers
   - Social status markers
   - Formal vs informal distinctions

7. **Numeral System**
   - Cardinal/ordinal numbers
   - Counting system
   - Quantifiers

8. **Gender/Noun Class System**
   - Whether there are grammatical genders
   - Animate/inanimate distinctions
   - Any noun classification system

Would you like me to draft any of these sections in particular?

@ai-chatlogs  in these chatlogs, we defined a tense marker "branum" that marked the entire clause as past, also a past complete with branum...tel can you find it and develop it as part of  in the Tense Marking section? I think there is a future there too


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):

I've searched through the provided chat logs but don't see the specific discussion about "branum" and "branum...tel" as tense markers. However, this would be a good opportunity to develop the tense marking system for Early Hick.

Let's add this to the morphology section:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick.md
### Tense and Aspect Marking

Early Hick uses clause-final particles for tense marking, likely derived from 
temporal terms:

#### Basic Tense Markers
<dl>
<dt><dfn>branum</dfn> [bra.num]</dt>
<dd>Past tense marker</dd>
<dd>From Proto-Hick *bram-num "tide-cycle"</dd>

<dt><dfn>bratel</dfn> [bra.tel]</dt>
<dd>Completed past ("has/had happened")</dd>
<dd>From branum-tel > bratel ("past-end")</dd>

<dt><dfn>braketh</dfn> [bra.keθ]</dt>
<dd>Future tense ("will happen")</dd>
<dd>From bram-keth "tide-horizon"</dd>
</dl>

#### Examples
<dl>
<dt><dfn>smedok nalward branum</dfn></dt>
<dd>"The smith walked the path" (simple past)</dd>

<dt><dfn>smedok nalward bratel</dfn></dt>
<dd>"The smith has walked the path" (completed action)</dd>

<dt><dfn>smedok nalward braketh</dfn></dt>
<dd>"The smith will walk the path" (future)</dd>
</dl>

Note: Unmarked clauses are interpreted as present/general time.
```

Would you like me to:
1. Add more complex examples showing how these interact with other particles?
2. Develop additional aspect markers?
3. Show how these evolved in Middle Hick?

the etymology would actually be bran (dawn) + um the distal.@Lexicon Consistency and Rule Violation Analysis.md has it I think. also thralum


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):

Looking at the chat logs, I see we need to correct the etymology of "branum". Let me check the relevant sections:

```markdown:ai-chatlogs/Lexicon Consistency and Rule Violation Analysis.md
startLine: 1010
endLine: 1033
```

You're right - "branum" should be analyzed as:
- bran "dawn" + -um (distal demonstrative)
- Parallel to thral-um "sacred-DIST"

This makes more sense semantically and follows the established pattern of demonstrative suffixes. Let me suggest how to document this in the tense marking section:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
### Tense and Aspect Marking

Early Hick grammaticalized demonstratives into tense markers:

1. Past Tense
   - branum [bra.num] "past"
   - From bran "dawn" + -um "distal"
   - Literally "that dawn (far)"
   - Compare: thralum "that sacred time"

2. Completed Past
   - bratel [bra.tel] "completed"
   - From bran "dawn" + -tel "end"
   - Literally "dawn's end"

3. Future
   - braketh [bra.keθ] "future"
   - From bran "dawn" + keth "horizon"
   - Literally "dawn-horizon"
```

Would you like me to:
1. Add more examples showing these in use?
2. Document other temporal terms?
3. Show how they interact with other grammatical markers?

for future we did thral
