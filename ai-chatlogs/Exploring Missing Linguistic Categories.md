Looking at the current documentation, here are some important linguistic categories that could be added to make the Early Hick description more complete:

1. **Aspect and Tense System**
   - How temporal relations are marked
   - Whether it's aspect-prominent or tense-prominent
   - Any tense/aspect markers and their usage

2. **Voice System**
   - While ergative-absolutive alignment is mentioned, specific voice markers
   - Passive/antipassive constructions
   - Middle voice if present

3. **Evidentiality**
   - Given it's a maritime/religious language, might have markers for:
   - Direct observation
   - Hearsay
   - Inference
   - Traditional knowledge

4. **Modality**
   - Epistemic modality (certainty/possibility)
   - Deontic modality (obligation/permission)
   - Modal particles or affixes

5. **Information Structure**
   - Topic/focus marking
   - Word order variations
   - Discourse particles

6. **Honorifics/Register**
   - Given the religious aspects, might have:
   - Sacred vs profane registers
   - Social status markers
   - Formal vs informal distinctions

7. **Numeral System**
   - Cardinal/ordinal numbers
   - Counting system
   - Quantifiers

8. **Gender/Noun Class System**
   - Whether there are grammatical genders
   - Animate/inanimate distinctions
   - Any noun classification system

Would you like me to draft any of these sections in particular?
