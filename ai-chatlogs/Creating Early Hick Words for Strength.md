# Creating Early Hick Words for Strength

_Created: 11/22/2024, 11:45:10 PM_

### User

@hick we need early hick words for "stability, strength, stiffness, and stubbornness", can we create a proto-hick root word and have them develop into different words? 

prefer current Proto-Hick reconstructions we already have, but feel free to invent new derivational strategies if the words would sound too similar

---

### AI (claude-3.5-sonnet)

Let me analyze the provided Early Hick lexicon and phonological patterns to create a coherent set of related words from a Proto-Hick root.

Looking at the sound changes and patterns shown in:

```71:109:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md


1. Final Vowel Loss (Pre-Early Hick)
   - \*-u > ∅ / \_#
   - Extremely regular:
     - \*thralu → thral "sacred"
     - \*malu → mal "pool"
     - \*toru → tor "height"
     - \*wadu → wad "path"
     - \*nesu → nes "fish"
2. Vowel Coalescence (Pre-Early Hick)
   - \*ahi → ai "water"
   - \*grau → gra "grey"
3. Early Hick Compound Formation Patterns
   - Regular compounding with no changes:
     - mur-mer → murmer "night-bird"
     - mur-kel → murkel "night sky"
     - kur-tin → kurtin "bronze"
   - Liquid/Nasal Deletion in Early Hick compounds:
     - thral-gral → thragral "sacred earth"
     - bram-mal → bramal "tidal pool"
     - val-mal → vamal "spirit pool"
   - Tri-element Compound Simplification (Early Hick innovation):
     - tor-mur-mer → tomur "great owl"
     - thur-mur-mer → thurmur "dusk owl"
     - li-mur-mer → limur "small owl"

## Relative Chronology

1. Pre-Early Hick

   - Final vowel loss (\*-u > ∅)
   - Vowel coalescence (\*ahi > ai)

2. Early Hick Period
   - Productive compound formation
   - Development of compound-specific sound changes
   - Innovation of tri-element compound simplification
```


And the existing vocabulary patterns in:

```1:100:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md


   - ris [ris] "reed" < Proto-Hick \*risu → ris
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - wud [wud] "wood, tree" < Proto-Hick \*wudu → wud
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - gras [gras] "grass" < Proto-Hick \*grasu → gras
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - sed [sed] "seed" < Proto-Hick \*sedu → sed
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - kel [kel] "leaf" < Proto-Hick \*kelu → kel
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - bran [bran] "branch" < Proto-Hick \*branu → bran
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
```


Here's my proposal:

Proto-Hick root: *staru "stand/remain"

This develops into Early Hick words:

1. star [star] "strength, stability" < Proto-Hick *staru → star
   (regular final vowel loss)

2. starel [sta.rel] "stubborn person" < star-el "strength-ERG" → starel
   (metaphorical extension using ergative case as derivational suffix)

3. stargar [star.gar] "stiffness" < star-gar "strength-stone" → stargar
   (compound with 'stone' to indicate physical hardness)

4. starok [sta.rok] "pillar, support" < star-ok "strength-AGENT" → starok
   (using the agentive suffix to create a concrete noun)

The semantic development follows patterns seen in Early Hick where:
- Physical concepts extend to personal qualities
- Compounds create specific technical meanings
- Agentive suffixes create concrete nouns from abstract concepts

This aligns with Early Hick's documented:
- Phonotactic constraints (allowing initial st-)
- Regular sound changes (final vowel loss)
- Compound formation patterns
- Metaphorical extensions using body/natural world imagery

The words maintain distinct enough forms while sharing the recognizable root star-, similar to other Early Hick word families.

### User

I'm fine with some of these being derived from extant derivational patterns, but I was hoping that some additional sound changes/derivational changes from proto-hick might obscure their connection with the root for at least some of these words

---

### AI (claude-3.5-sonnet)

Looking at the Early Hick sound changes and derivational patterns, let me propose a more 
etymologically diverse set of related words with some obscured connections:

Proto-Hick root: *staru "stand/remain" (as proposed before)

And a secondary related root: *stenu "stiff, rigid"

These develop into Early Hick words through different paths:

1. *staru → star "strength" 
   (regular final vowel loss, most transparent connection to root)

2. *stenu-alu → stenal → snal "stubborn person"
   (compound with "person" morpheme, then syncope of first syllable - a new sound 
   change we can add for Proto-Hick compounds)

3. *staru-garu → stargar → sargar "stability" 
   (compound with "stone", then dissimilation of first /r/ - another new sound 
   change we can propose)

4. *stenu-thiru → stenthir "stiffness"
   (compound with "white/air", metaphorical extension to abstract quality)

This proposal adds two new Proto-Hick sound changes:

1. Syncope in compounds:
   *CVCV-VCV → CCV-VCV
   (e.g. *stenu-alu → stenal → snal)

2. /r/ dissimilation:
   r...r → Ø...r / in compounds
   (e.g. *stargar → sargar)

These changes are typologically plausible and help create more phonological 
diversity while maintaining semantic connections. They're also consistent with 
existing patterns shown in:


```74:109:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

1. Final Vowel Loss (Pre-Early Hick)
   - \*-u > ∅ / \_#
   - Extremely regular:
     - \*thralu → thral "sacred"
     - \*malu → mal "pool"
     - \*toru → tor "height"
     - \*wadu → wad "path"
     - \*nesu → nes "fish"
2. Vowel Coalescence (Pre-Early Hick)
   - \*ahi → ai "water"
   - \*grau → gra "grey"
3. Early Hick Compound Formation Patterns
   - Regular compounding with no changes:
     - mur-mer → murmer "night-bird"
     - mur-kel → murkel "night sky"
     - kur-tin → kurtin "bronze"
   - Liquid/Nasal Deletion in Early Hick compounds:
     - thral-gral → thragral "sacred earth"
     - bram-mal → bramal "tidal pool"
     - val-mal → vamal "spirit pool"
   - Tri-element Compound Simplification (Early Hick innovation):
     - tor-mur-mer → tomur "great owl"
     - thur-mur-mer → thurmur "dusk owl"
     - li-mur-mer → limur "small owl"

## Relative Chronology

1. Pre-Early Hick

   - Final vowel loss (\*-u > ∅)
   - Vowel coalescence (\*ahi > ai)

2. Early Hick Period
   - Productive compound formation
   - Development of compound-specific sound changes
```


The semantic development follows attested patterns of metaphorical extension seen 
in:


```124:129:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

1. Core Vocabulary
   - \*thralu "sacred" → thral "sacred; day"
   - \*kelu "sky" kel "sky; blue"
2. Extended Meanings
   - \*toru "height" → tor- augmentative prefix
```


This gives us four related but phonologically distinct words for the concepts, with 
varying degrees of transparency in their etymological connection.

### User

ok, let's add those proposed sound changes to the proto-hick reconstrouction section

---

### AI (claude-3.5-sonnet)

Based on the existing sound changes section in the file, I'll add the new sound 
changes. Looking at:


```71:84:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Sound Changes from Proto-Hick to Early Hick

1. Final Vowel Loss (Pre-Early Hick)
   - \*-u > ∅ / \_#
   - Extremely regular:
     - \*thralu → thral "sacred"
     - \*malu → mal "pool"
     - \*toru → tor "height"
     - \*wadu → wad "path"
     - \*nesu → nes "fish"
2. Vowel Coalescence (Pre-Early Hick)
   - \*ahi → ai "water"
   - \*grau → gra "grey"
3. Early Hick Compound Formation Patterns
```


I'll expand this section to include our new changes. Here's the updated version:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Sound Changes from Proto-Hick to Early Hick

1. Final Vowel Loss (Pre-Early Hick)
   - \*-u > ∅ / \_#
   - Extremely regular:
     - \*thralu → thral "sacred"
     - \*malu → mal "pool"
     - \*toru → tor "height"
     - \*wadu → wad "path"
     - \*nesu → nes "fish"

2. Vowel Coalescence (Pre-Early Hick)
   - \*ahi → ai "water"
   - \*grau → gra "grey"

3. Compound-Specific Changes (Early Proto-Hick)
   - Syncope in compounds:
     - \*CVCV-VCV → CCV-VCV
     - \*stenu-alu → stenal → snal
     - \*menu-alu → menal → mnal
   - /r/ dissimilation in compounds:
     - r...r → ∅...r / in compounds
     - \*staru-garu → stargar → sargar
     - \*maru-ris → marris → maris

4. Early Hick Compound Formation Patterns
   - Regular compounding with no changes:
     - mur-mer → murmer "night-bird"
     - mur-kel → murkel "night sky"
     - kur-tin → kurtin "bronze"
   - Liquid/Nasal Deletion in Early Hick compounds:
     - thral-gral → thragral "sacred earth"
     - bram-mal → bramal "tidal pool"
     - val-mal → vamal "spirit pool"
   - Tri-element Compound Simplification (Early Hick innovation):
     - tor-mur-mer → tomur "great owl"
     - thur-mur-mer → thurmur "dusk owl"
     - li-mur-mer → limur "small owl"
```

This addition maintains consistency with existing patterns while adding our new sound 
changes as a distinct phase. The examples use the same formatting as existing entries 
and follow similar patterns to other documented changes.

The new changes are placed as #3, before the existing compound formation patterns, 
since they represent an earlier stage of development that feeds into the later 
compound patterns.

### User

we seem to be missing a sound change that glotallizes /h/ in certain environments... I think we have some discussion of it in @ai-chatlogs 

---

### AI (claude-3.5-sonnet)

Looking at the chat logs, I can piece together the development of Proto-Hick *h > ʔ. 
From these sections:

```markdown:ai-chatlogs/Morphology Section Cross-Check and Verification.md
startLine: 1396
endLine: 1413
```

And:

```markdown:ai-chatlogs/Morphology Section Cross-Check and Verification.md
startLine: 1669
endLine: 1683
```

We can see that Proto-Hick *hi- had two developments:
1. *hi- > i- (vowel preservation)
2. *hi- > ʔ- (consonant preservation as glottal stop)

Let's add this sound change to the Proto-Hick reconstruction section:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Sound Changes from Proto-Hick to Early Hick

1. Initial *h Developments
   - *h > ʔ / #_ (word-initially)
     - *hi-al > ʔal "person"
     - *hi-ok > ʔok "agent"
   - *h > ∅ / #_i (before /i/)
     - *hi-mer > imer "soul"
     - *hi-mur > imur "evil force"
   - *h preserved in some sacred terms
     - *halu > hal "holy"

2. Final Vowel Loss (Pre-Early Hick)
   - *-u > ∅ / _#
   [rest of existing sound changes...]
```

This explains both the presence of glottal stops and initial vowels in Early Hick as 
coming from the same Proto-Hick source, with the environment determining which outcome 
occurred.

Would you like me to:
1. Add more examples of this sound change?
2. Explore how it interacts with other sound changes?
3. Document any exceptions or special cases?

---

### User

hmm could we have *halu > thal maybe? if it's naturalistic?

---

### AI (claude-3.5-sonnet)

Looking at the sound changes and phonological patterns shown in the code blocks, 
particularly:

```markdown:ai-chatlogs/Noble Houses and Political Development in Senera.md
startLine: 2164
endLine: 2190
```

And:


```73:84:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md


1. Final Vowel Loss (Pre-Early Hick)
   - \*-u > ∅ / \_#
   - Extremely regular:
     - \*thralu → thral "sacred"
     - \*malu → mal "pool"
     - \*toru → tor "height"
     - \*wadu → wad "path"
     - \*nesu → nes "fish"
2. Vowel Coalescence (Pre-Early Hick)
   - \*ahi → ai "water"
```


The change from *halu > thal would be less naturalistic than some alternatives. Here's 
why:

1. The development of initial /h/ > /θ/ (th) is attested, but usually occurs through 
   intermediate stages
2. We already have evidence of final -u loss in Early Hick
3. The change would need to explain why /h/ becomes /θ/ only in this word

Instead, I'd suggest either:

1. *thalu > thal (if it was already a /θ/-initial word in Proto-Hick)
   - This follows the regular final vowel loss pattern
   - Maintains the sacred/ritual association of /θ/

OR

2. *halu > hal > thal
   - Where /h/ > /θ/ is a specific sound change in sacred/ritual terms
   - This could be motivated by the need to distinguish sacred vocabulary
   - Similar to how some languages develop special phonological features in ritual 
     registers

The second option could be interesting as it gives us a motivated sound change that 
only affects sacred terminology, which fits with the cultural context of Early Hick.

Would you like me to develop either of these alternatives with more detailed sound 
changes?

---

### User

halu > hal > thal seems reasonable. it could have good implications of having minimal pairs between some glottalized initial and some religious terminology

---

### AI (claude-3.5-sonnet)

Yes! Looking at the patterns in the chat logs and the existing sound changes, we 
could propose:

Proto-Hick had a distinction between:
1. *hi- (animacy marker) > ʔ- or i- (as shown in lines 1669-1683)
2. *ha- (sacred/ritual marker) > θ- (th-)

This gives us some interesting minimal pairs:
- *halu "holy" > thal vs. *hi-alu "person" > ʔal
- *haru "ritual" > thar vs. *hi-aru "spirit" > ʔar

Let's add this to the sound changes section:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Sound Changes from Proto-Hick to Early Hick

1. Initial *h Development
   a. Animacy marker *hi-:
      - *hi- > i- / _i (before /i/)
      - *hi- > ʔ- (elsewhere)
      Examples:
      - *hi-mer > imer "soul"
      - *hi-al > ʔal "person"
   
   b. Sacred marker *ha-:
      - *ha- > θ- (th-) 
      Examples:
      - *halu > hal > thal "holy"
      - *haru > har > thar "ritual"

2. Final Vowel Loss
   [rest of existing sound changes...]
```

This creates a systematic distinction between:
- Animate beings/forces (marked by ʔ- or i-)
- Sacred/ritual concepts (marked by th-)

The development *ha- > θ- is typologically plausible and helps explain the 
distribution of th- in religious terminology.

### User

hmm could hi become glottalized in non word initial contexts? then before actual early hick lose glotallization and have some implications with prosody?

---

### AI (claude-3.5-sonnet)

Yes! This could create an interesting intermediate stage between Proto-Hick and Early 
Hick. Looking at the patterns in:

```markdown:ai-chatlogs/Morphology Section Cross-Check and Verification.md
startLine: 6879
endLine: 6908
```

We could revise the sound changes to include this intermediate stage. Here's a 
proposed update:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Sound Changes from Proto-Hick to Early Hick

1. Initial *h Development (Pre-Early Hick)
   a. Word-initial position:
      - *hi- > i- / _i (before /i/)
      - *hi- > ʔi- (elsewhere)
      Examples:
      - *hi-mer > imer "soul"
      - *hi-al > ʔal "person"
   
   b. Non-initial position:
      - *VhiC > VʔiC (medial glottalization)
      - *VhiV > VʔiV
      Examples:
      - *ahi-mer > aʔimer "water-spirit"
      - *mahi-ter > maʔiter "pool-flow"

2. Glottal Loss with Prosodic Effects (Early Proto-Hick)
   - VʔiC > V́iC (stress shift)
   - VʔiV > V́iV
   Examples:
   - aʔimer > áimer "water-spirit"
   - maʔiter > máiter "pool-flow"

3. Final Vowel Loss
   [rest of existing changes...]
```

This creates a pathway where:
1. *h first becomes ʔ in all non-initial hi sequences
2. The glottal stop is then lost but leaves a prosodic trace
3. This explains some irregular stress patterns in compounds

Would you like me to:
1. Add more examples of this development?
2. Show how it interacts with other sound changes?
3. Detail the prosodic implications?

---

### User

are we adding tone here? hmmm maybe not. could there be other implications of medial glottalization?

---

### AI (claude-3.5-sonnet)

You're right - let's avoid adding tone. Looking at the patterns in the chat logs 
and the current sound changes, medial glottalization could have other interesting 
implications:

1. Stress patterns - glottalized syllables could attract stress before the glottal 
   is lost:
   - *VhiCV > VʔiCV > V́iCV

2. Vowel length - compensatory lengthening when the glottal is lost:
   - *VhiCV > VʔiCV > V̄iCV

3. Vowel quality - the /i/ after the lost glottal could affect neighboring vowels:
   - *ahi-mer > aʔimer > aimer [ai.mer] 
   - *uhi-ter > uʔiter > uiter [ui.ter]

Let's add this to the sound changes section:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Sound Changes from Proto-Hick to Early Hick

1. Medial *h Development
   a. Glottalization:
      - *VhiC > VʔiC
      Examples:
      - *ahi-mer > aʔimer "water-spirit"
      - *uhi-ter > uʔiter "dark-flow"
   
   b. Glottal Loss with Prosodic Effects:
      - VʔiC > V́iC (stress shift)
      - VʔiC > V̄iC (compensatory lengthening)
      Examples:
      - aʔimer > áimer "water-spirit"
      - uʔiter > ūiter "dark-flow"

2. [rest of existing sound changes...]
```

This creates a natural pathway for:
1. Stress patterns in compounds
2. Development of long vowels
3. Formation of new diphthongs
4. Preservation of morphological boundaries

Would you like me to:
1. Add more examples?
2. Show how this interacts with other changes?
3. Detail dialectal variations?

---

### User

not sure if it's just because I'm not used to it, but is VhiC > VʔiC really attested naturally? or could that be why it reduces quickly?

---

### AI (claude-3.5-sonnet)

You raise a good point about the naturalness of VhiC > VʔiC. Looking at 
the historical development patterns shown in:

```markdown:ai-chatlogs/Lexicon Consistency and Rule Violation Analysis.md
startLine: 6950
endLine: 6988
```

And:

```markdown:ai-chatlogs/Morphology Section Cross-Check and Verification.md
startLine: 1236
endLine: 1245
```

The medial glottalization seems less typologically natural. Instead, we could have:

1. Proto-Hick *VhiC sequences reduce more directly:
   - *VhiC > ViC (h-loss with no intermediate glottal)
   - *ahi-mer > aimer "water-spirit"
   - *uhi-ter > uiter "dark-flow"

2. This aligns better with:
   - The preference for CVC(V) syllables
   - The constraint against certain VCV sequences
   - The general pattern of h-loss

Let's update the sound changes section:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Sound Changes from Proto-Hick to Early Hick

1. Medial *h Loss
   a. In VhiC sequences:
      - *VhiC > ViC (direct h-loss)
      Examples:
      - *ahi-mer > aimer "water-spirit"
      - *uhi-ter > uiter "dark-flow"
   
   b. Stress remains on first syllable:
      - *áhi-mer > áimer
      - *úhi-ter > úiter

2. [rest of existing sound changes...]
```

This simpler development path seems more naturalistic while still explaining the 
attested forms. Would you like me to:
1. Add more examples?
2. Show how this interacts with other changes?
3. Explore dialectal variations?

---

### User

I think what we should look for instead would be good patterns to increase attested glottal stops in early hick first. so we can't have our only evolutionary path be hi > ʔ- 

---

### AI (claude-3.5-sonnet)

You're right - we need more sources for glottal stops in Early Hick beyond just 
the *hi- > ʔ- development. Looking at the patterns in the chat logs:

```markdown:ai-chatlogs/Discussion on Hick Language Consonant Clusters.md
startLine: 4615
endLine: 4637
```

And:

```markdown:ai-chatlogs/Morphology Section Cross-Check and Verification.md
startLine: 1236
endLine: 1245
```

We could propose additional sources for glottal stops:

1. Word-initial vowel sequences get a glottal stop:
   - *ai > ʔai "water"
   - *el > ʔel "stone" 
   - *ur > ʔur "dark"

2. Certain consonant clusters develop a glottal stop:
   - *sk- > ʔk- / #_
   - *st- > ʔt- / #_
   - Example: *skel > ʔkel "sky-opening"

3. Compound boundaries with vowel hiatus:
   - tor-ai > torʔai "great-water"
   - mal-el > malʔel "pool-stone"

Let's add this to the sound changes section:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Sound Changes from Proto-Hick to Early Hick

1. Glottal Stop Development
   a. Word-initial vowels:
      - *#V > ʔV
      Examples:
      - *ai > ʔai "water"
      - *el > ʔel "stone"
   
   b. Initial clusters:
      - *#sC > ʔC
      Examples:
      - *skel > ʔkel "sky-opening"
      - *ster > ʔter "flow"
   
   c. Compound boundaries:
      - V-V > VʔV
      Examples:
      - tor-ai > torʔai "great-water"
      - mal-el > malʔel "pool-stone"

2. [rest of existing sound changes...]
```

Would you like me to:
1. Add more examples of these patterns?
2. Show how they interact with stress?
3. Detail dialectal variations?

### User

we should maintain minimal pair for <word>/ʔ<word> though so 1 might not work... 2 might seem hood. we don't have valid complex onsets with sibilant/fricative then plosive. could be why they don't exist in early hick somehow

---

### AI (claude-3.5-sonnet)

You make a good point about maintaining minimal pairs and complex onsets. Looking at the patterns in:

```markdown:ai-chatlogs/Discussion on Hick Language Consonant Clusters.md
startLine: 815
endLine: 855
```

We could propose that Proto-Hick *sC clusters developed in two ways:

1. Word-initial position:
   - *sC > ʔC (creating minimal pairs with plain C-)
   - *skel > ʔkel "sky-opening" vs. kel "sky"
   - *ster > ʔter "flow" vs. ter "path"

2. Compound-internal position:
   - *-sC- preserved in compounds
   - *kel-ster > kelster "sky-flow"
   - *mal-skel > malskel "pool-opening"

Let's add this to the sound changes:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Sound Changes from Proto-Hick to Early Hick

1. Initial Cluster Simplification
   a. *sC > ʔC / #_
      Examples:

      - *ster > ʔter "flow"
   
   b. *-sC- preserved in compounds:
      - *kel-ster > kelster "sky-flow"
      - *mal-skel > malskel "pool-opening"

2. [rest of existing sound changes...]
```

This explains:
1. Why Early Hick lacks initial sC clusters
2. How we get minimal pairs with glottal stops
3. Why compounds can preserve clusters medially
4. The distribution of complex onsets

Would you like me to:
1. Add more examples?
2. Show how this interacts with other changes?
3. Detail dialectal variations?

do we have medial sC onsets? I thought we only had those in coda position

---

### AI (claude-3.5-sonnet)



You're right - looking at the consonant cluster patterns in:

```markdown:ai-chatlogs/Discussion on Hick Language Consonant Clusters.md
startLine: 61
endLine: 72
```

We only have sC clusters in coda position, not as onsets. This means we should 
revise some of our forms. For example:

1. [mur.skel] should be restructured to avoid the medial sC onset
2. Could become [mur.es.kel] following CV preference
3. Then reduces to [mo.res.kel] in Modern Seneran

Let's revise the dialect section:

```markdown
### Hidden Features

<dl>
<dt><dfn>murmal</dfn> [mur.mal]</dt>
<dd>"dark pool" (hidden dock)</dd>

<dt><dfn>murekel</dfn> [mur.e.kel]</dt>
<dd>"night vessel" (smuggling ship)</dd>

<dt><dfn>wardmur</dfn> [ward.mur]</dt>
<dd>"hidden path" (secret channel)</dd>

<dt><dfn>murwud</dfn> [mur.wud]</dt>
<dd>"dark forest" (hidden storage)</dd>
</dl>

### Modern Seneran Adaptations

<dl>
<dt><dfn>mormel</dfn> [mor.mel]</dt>
<dd>Vowel lowering and harmony: [mur.mal] → [mor.mel]</dd>

<dt><dfn>morekel</dfn> [mo.re.kel]</dt>

<dt><dfn>morwud</dfn> [mor.wud]</dt>
<dd>Vowel lowering only: [mur] → [mor]</dd>
</dl>
```

Would you like me to revise other forms that might have incorrect medial sC 
clusters?

---

### User

at least in early hick, I don't think we even have this problem in our lexicon atm. forms in this stage that have "-skel" is [is.kel], which is already valid... but the point is, yes I do like that proto-hick sound change sC > ʔC / 
also we have to mark for glottal stop without using the IPA symbol for ease of typing at least phonemically. perhaps apostrophe?

---

### AI (claude-3.5-sonnet)



You're right on both counts - let's use apostrophe for marking glottal stops 
phonemically and confirm that our current lexicon doesn't have problematic sC 
clusters. Looking at:

   - murlis [mur.lis] "night-eye" < mur-lis "night-eye" → murlis
```


The only relevant form is [is.kel], which as you note is already valid syllable 
structure. Let's formalize this in our sound changes:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Sound Changes from Proto-Hick to Early Hick

1. Initial Cluster Simplification
   a. *sC > 'C / #_
      Examples:
      - *skel > 'kel "opening"
      - *ster > 'ter "flow"
   
   b. Medial clusters resyllabified:
      - *is-kel > [is.kel] "out-sky"
      - *as-ter > [as.ter] "up-flow"

Note: Glottal stop written as <'> in phonemic transcription, [ʔ] in phonetic.
```

This explains:
1. Why Early Hick lacks initial sC clusters
2. How we get minimal pairs with glottal stops
3. Why compounds maintain valid syllable structure
4. The use of apostrophe in transcription

Would you like me to:
1. Add more examples?
2. Show how this interacts with other changes?
3. Detail dialectal variations?

---

### User

perhaps medially, proto-hicl sC might be re-analyzed to split the s to coda position and C to onset of the following syllable? 

so say if the word was coined in proto-hick haru.skel for example it  could become har.us.kel ?

---

### AI (claude-3.5-sonnet)

Yes, that's a good solution for medial sC clusters! This would maintain our syllable 
structure constraints while explaining historical developments. Let's trace how it 
would work:

Proto-Hick:
- *haru.skel [ha.ru.skel] "bright opening"

Early Hick resyllabification:
1. Insert epenthetic vowel: [ha.ru.sə.kel]
2. Vowel harmony: [ha.ru.se.kel]
3. Final form: [ha.rus.kel]

This pattern would be consistent with:


```389:393:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md

1. Basic Terms
   - iskel [is.kel] "window" < is-kel "out-sky" → iskel
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - iskelai [is.ke.lai] "window condensation" < iskel-ai "window-water" →
```


Where we see [is.kel] from *is-kel showing the same syllable structure.

We could formalize this as a sound change rule:

```markdown
### Medial Cluster Resolution
- *sC > s.C / V_V
  - *VsCV > Vs.CV
  - Maintains valid syllable contacts
  - Preserves both consonants
```

Would you like me to:
1. Add more examples of this pattern?
2. Show how it interacts with compound boundaries?
3. Detail any exceptions or special cases?

---

### User

I like it, because it'll allow us to preserve the -u root as some regular pattern. anyway let's add these new sound change rules to the Proto-Hick Reconstruction section first, and then add examples on how sC interacts with compound boundaries.

perhaps we can explore if other sibilants/fricatives used to exist in proto-hick that could disappear in early-hick

---

### AI (claude-3.5-sonnet)

Yes! Let's update the Proto-Hick Reconstruction section with these new sound changes and explore other possible fricatives. Looking at:


```71:109:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Sound Changes from Proto-Hick to Early Hick

1. Initial *h Development
   a. Animacy marker *hi-:
      - *hi- > i- / _i (before /i/)
      - *hi- > ʔ- (elsewhere)
      Examples:
      - *hi-mer > imer "soul"
      - *hi-al > ʔal "person"
   
   b. Sacred marker *ha-:
      - *ha- > θ- (th-) 
      Examples:
      - *halu > hal > thal "holy"
      - *haru > har > thar "ritual"

2. Final Vowel Loss (Pre-Early Hick)
   - *-u > ∅ / _#
   - Extremely regular:
     - \*thralu → thral "sacred"
     - \*malu → mal "pool"
     - \*toru → tor "height"
     - \*wadu → wad "path"
     - \*nesu → nes "fish"

3. Vowel Coalescence (Pre-Early Hick)
   - \*ahi → ai "water"
   - \*grau → gra "grey"

4. Compound-Specific Changes (Early Proto-Hick)
   - Syncope in compounds:
     - \*CVCV-VCV → CCV-VCV
     - \*stenu-alu → stenal → snal
     - \*menu-alu → menal → mnal
   - /r/ dissimilation in compounds:
     - r...r → ∅...r / in compounds
     - \*staru-garu → stargar → sargar
     - \*maru-ris → marris → maris

```


Let's add these changes:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Sound Changes from Proto-Hick to Early Hick

1. Initial Cluster Simplification
   a. *sC > 'C / #_
      Examples:
      - *skel > 'kel "opening"
      - *ster > 'ter "flow"
   
   b. Medial clusters resyllabified:
      - *is-kel > [is.kel] "out-sky"
      - *as-ter > [as.ter] "up-flow"

2. Other Initial Fricative Loss
   a. *ʃC > sC / #_
      - *ʃkel > skel > 'kel "cave"
      - *ʃter > ster > 'ter "stream"
   
   b. *x > h / #_
      - *xalu > halu > al "stone"
      - *xiru > hiru > ir "iron"

3. Final Vowel Loss
   [existing rules...]
```

This suggests Proto-Hick had a richer fricative inventory (*s, *ʃ, *x, *h) that 
was simplified in Early Hick. The glottal stop outcomes preserve evidence of these 
earlier distinctions.

Would you like me to:
1. Add more examples of these patterns?
2. Show how they interact with compounds?
3. Detail dialectal variations?

---

### User

I suppose in sections where we're concerned with phonetics, we can retain the symbol for glottal stops. can we distinguish the use of apostrophe to mean glottal stop phonemically, but phonetically we still use the IPA symbol?

---

### AI (claude-3.5-sonnet)

Yes, we can use that distinction! Looking at the current file:


```215:222:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
     - /ei-ae/ → [e.e]
     - /ai-ae/ → [ae]
   - No three-vowel sequences

2. Examples:
   - /kei-aes/ → [ke.es] "sky flow"
   - /thrai-aes/ → [thraes] "sacred flow"
   - /brai-aes/ → [braes] "swift flow"
```


Let's update the consonant inventory section and add a note about notation:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
### Consonants

|            | Labial | Dental | Alveolar | Velar | Glottal |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | -------- | ----- | ------- |
| Stops      | p b    |        | t d      | k g   | '       |
| Fricatives | f      | θ      | s        |       |         |
| Nasals     | m      |        | n        |       |         |
| Liquids    |        |        | l r      |       |         |

Note: The glottal stop is written as <'> in phonemic transcription and [ʔ] in 
phonetic transcription.

Examples:
- /'al/ [ʔal] "person"
- /'el/ [ʔel] "speaker" 
- /ma'er/ [maʔer] "spirit-breath"
```

This convention would help us:
1. Keep transcriptions readable in running text
2. Maintain precision in phonetic descriptions
3. Show the phonemic status clearly
4. Make typing easier in documentation

Would you like me to update other sections to reflect this notation system?

---

### User

I returned the glottal fricative [h] for now, since I'm not 100% sure if I want it to be preserved in some cases for early hick

---

### AI (claude-3.5-sonnet)



Looking at the lexicon and sound changes, I see we're already using glottal stops 
consistently. Let's keep [h] for now but mark where it appears. From the current 
lexicon:


```469:473:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md

1. Basic Terms

   - bao [ba.o] "father" < Proto-Hick \*bawu → bao
     ([vowel coalescence](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
```


We see words like "nai" from *nahi showing h-loss with vowel coalescence. But we 
also have:


```74:86:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   a. Animacy marker *hi-:
1. Final Vowel Loss (Pre-Early Hick)
   - \*-u > ∅ / \_#
   - Extremely regular:
     - \*thralu → thral "sacred"
     - \*malu → mal "pool"
     - \*toru → tor "height"
     - \*wadu → wad "path"
     - \*nesu → nes "fish"
2. Vowel Coalescence (Pre-Early Hick)
   - \*ahi → ai "water"
   - \*grau → gra "grey"
3. Early Hick Compound Formation Patterns
```


Where *h- develops into either [i] or [ʔ] in the animacy prefix, but into [θ] in 
the sacred prefix.

I suggest we keep this three-way split for now:
1. *h > ∅ with vowel coalescence between vowels
2. *h > ʔ in the animacy prefix (except before /i/)
3. *h > θ in the sacred prefix

This gives us:
- Regular sound change (*nahi > nai)
- Grammaticalized prefix (*hi- > ʔ-)
- Sacred vocabulary (*ha- > θa-)

Would you like me to:
1. Find more examples of each pattern?
2. Show how this interacts with compounds?
3. Detail any exceptions?

---

### User

we already have a word for stone *garu > gar
and stream *ranu > ran

I could see how 'iter/ter may develop a nice pair with semantic connections though. maybe good to make it coincidental...

---

### AI (claude-3.5-sonnet)



You're right! Looking at the lexicon:


```39:41:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
     [Colors](#colors)
   - gar [gar] "stone" < Proto-Hick \*garu → gar ([final vowel loss])
   - gral [gral] "earth, soil" < Proto-Hick \*gralu → gral ([final vowel loss])
```


We have *garu > gar for "stone" and:


```48:51:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
     See: [Maritime Terms](#maritime-terms)
   - ran [ran] "stream, flowing water" < Proto-Hick \*ranu → ran
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - toran [to.ran] "river, flowing water" < Proto-Hick \*ranu → ran
```


We have *ranu > ran for "stream".

Let's revise the sound changes to show *ter as a distinct root meaning "flow" that 
coincidentally develops similar forms:

```markdown
### Proto-Hick Roots

1. Basic Motion Terms
   - *teru "flow" > ter 
   - *ranu "stream" > ran
   
2. Basic Material Terms  
   - *garu "stone" > gar
   - *xalu "rock" > al (through *halu)

This gives us nice semantic pairs:
- ter/ran: fluid motion vs water feature
- gar/al: worked stone vs natural rock
```

Would you like me to:
1. Add more examples of these semantic pairs?
2. Show how they combine differently in compounds?
3. Detail their different distributions in place names?

---

### User

yeah, this also opens up more potential for dialectal differentiation. like hi-teru "ANIM.flow" > i-ter "stream". but let's not get into it now.

for now let's apply these changes to @_index.md  and let's add the new words and update sense in @lexicon.md , perhaps also in @lexicon.jsonld (ontolex-lemon) as well

---

### AI (claude-3.5-sonnet)

Let's systematically update these files. First, let's update `_index.md` with the 
corrected directional system and animacy marking:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
### Directional System

1. Basic Directionals
   - -aes: illative "inward, into" < *lawes "consume/take in"
   - -imris: ellative "outward, from" < *imer-is "breath-out"
   - -itar: superior "upward" < *hi-ter "ANIM-tail/end"
   - -asam: inferior "downward" < *as-am "down-at"

2. Development Paths
   a. Illative Formation:
      - *lawes > *laes > -aes
      - Parallel: *wel > bel "mouth"
      - Original compound: *wel-lawes "mouth-consume" > *belaes "intake"
   
   b. Ellative Formation:
      - *imer-is > *imeris > -imris
      - Shows body-action grammaticalization
      - Preserved in: imeraes "inspiration", imerimris "expression"

3. Example Usage
   - materok rismateraes kethes "the boatman (goes) into the reed boat"
   - materok rismaterimris kethes "the boatman (goes) out from the reed boat"
   - materok rismateritar kethes "the boatman (goes) up onto the reed boat"
   - materok rismaterasam kethes "the boatman (goes) down from the reed boat"
```

For the lexicon updates, I'll reference the existing entries and add new ones:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Directional Terms

1. Basic Terms
   - ter [ter] "tail, end" < Proto-Hick *teru → ter
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick))
   - is [is] "out" < Proto-Hick *isu → is
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick))
   - as [as] "down" < Proto-Hick *asu → as
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick))

2. Grammaticalized Forms
   - -aes [-aes] "into" < Proto-Hick *lawes → aes
     ([grammaticalization](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#directional-system))
   - -imris [-im.ris] "out from" < Proto-Hick *imer-is → imris
     ([grammaticalization](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#directional-system))
```

Would you like me to:
1. Continue with the JSON-LD updates?
2. Add more examples of animacy marking?
3. Update the cross-reference index?

---

### User

you seem to have confused yourself. we were updating the proto-hick examples and roots, then also some derived roots for early hick? for the stone/rock pair and the flow/stream pair? then adding those words and changes in senses to the lexicon documents?

---

### AI (claude-3.5-sonnet)

You're right - let me focus on just updating the Proto-Hick roots and their developments.

From the current `_index.md`, we have these sound changes:


```129:145:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - \*toru "height" → tor- augmentative prefix
   - \*muru "night" → base for owl terminology
   
## Directional System Development
      - *is-kel > [is.kel] "out-sky"
1. Illative (-aes)
   - From Proto-Hick \*lawes "consume/take in"
   - Sound changes:
     - *lawes > *laes > -aes
   - Parallel development with \*wel > bel "mouth"
   - Original compound: \*wel-lawes "mouth-consume"
     - > *wellaes > *belaes "intake"
     - Grammaticalized to directional marker -aes
2. Ellative (-imris)
   - From compound: *imer "breath" + *is "out"
   - Shows parallel grammaticalization:
     - Body action > directional marker
```


Let's systematically add these roots and their developments to the lexicon:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Motion and Flow Terms

1. Basic Terms
   - ter [ter] "flow" < Proto-Hick *teru → ter
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick))
   - ran [ran] "stream" < Proto-Hick *ranu → ran
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick))

### Material Terms

1. Basic Terms
   - gar [gar] "worked stone" < Proto-Hick *garu → gar
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick))
   - al [al] "natural rock" < Proto-Hick *xalu → halu → al
     ([initial fricative loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick))
```

Would you like me to:
1. Add more derived terms using these roots?
2. Show how they combine in compounds?
3. Update the cross-reference index?
