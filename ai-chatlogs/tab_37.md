@proto-hick.md we have a new phonotactic rule in proto hick where we must have a null coda in final position. this may require us to change our proto-hick lative cases. what impact might it have in @early-hick where those evolved into spatial demonstratives?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Let me analyze this based on the provided code blocks.

Looking at the Early Hick spatial demonstratives and case system:


```426:438:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
2. Functional Development:
```


And the spatial case system:


```513:527:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
2. Functional Development:
```


The impact of requiring null codas in Proto-Hick would be significant:

1. **Spatial Cases**:
   - Current forms like -aes, -imris, -itar would need to be reconstructed from 
     Proto-Hick forms with open syllables
   - Possible reconstructions:
     - *-ae.su > -aes
     - *i.mi.ri.su > -imris 
     - *i.ta.ru > -itar

2. **Demonstratives**:
   - Forms like -is, -eth, -um were likely derived from these spatial cases
   - Would need to reconstruct:
     - *i.su > -is
     - *e.thu > -eth
     - *u.mu > -um

3. **Historical Development**:
   - Early Hick shows a pattern of final vowel loss:

```321:324:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
1. Sound Changes:

   - \*mela > \*mel (final vowel loss)
   - \*mel > -el (initial m-loss in unstressed position)
```


4. **Systematic Changes**:
   - The null coda rule in Proto-Hick would explain why Early Hick developed such 
     a robust system of final consonant clusters - they emerged from the loss of 
     final vowels
   - This matches the documented sound changes:

```49:54:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
# Core Grammar

## Case System

1. Primary Cases

```


5. **Impact on Analysis**:
   - Would require revising etymologies throughout the lexicon
   - Would provide a more regular explanation for Early Hick's complex coda 
     clusters
   - Better explains the relationship between spatial cases and demonstratives
   - Matches known typological patterns of case development

This change would actually strengthen the historical analysis by providing a more 
regular sound change pattern from Proto-Hick to Early Hick.

let's update the proto-hick document to update latives/words that may violate this rule


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Based on the provided code blocks, I'll help update the Proto-Hick document. Here are the key patterns we need to account for:

1. **Final Vowel Evidence**
From the lexicon, we see consistent patterns of final vowel loss:

```101:111:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
1. Basic Plant Terms

   - ris [ris] "reed" < Proto-Hick \*risu → ris
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - wud [wud] "wood, tree" < Proto-Hick \*wudu → wud
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - gras [gras] "grass" < Proto-Hick \*grasu → gras
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - s [sed] "seed" < Proto-Hick \*sedu → sed
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - kel [kel] "leaf" < Proto-Hick \*kelu → kel
```


2. **Case System Development**
Looking at Early Hick's spatial cases:

```307:314:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

2. Spatial Cases (See: [Spatial Case System](#spatial-case-system))
   - Spatial cases mark the goal of the motion verb, supplanting the use of the
     ergative case in those contexts.
     - -aes (ILL): "inward, into"
     - -imris (ELL): "outward, from"
     - -itar (SUPE): "upward, upon"
     - -esp (SUB): "under, below"
```


Here's how we should update Proto-Hick:

```markdown
# Proto-Hick Lative Cases

Original reconstructions should be updated to:

1. Basic Directionals:
   - *aesu > Early Hick -aes "inward, into"
   - *imirisu > Early Hick -imris "outward, from"
   - *itaru > Early Hick -itar "upward, upon"
   - *espu > Early Hick -esp "under, below"
   - *asamu > Early Hick -asam "downward, onto"

2. Core Vocabulary Updates:
   - *kelu > Early Hick kel "sky"
   - *malu > Early Hick mal "pool"
   - *toru > Early Hick tor "height"
   - *risu > Early Hick ris "reed"
   - *wadu > Early Hick wad "path"
   - *meru > Early Hick mer "bird"
   - *thiru > Early Hick thir "white/air"
   - *gralu > Early Hick gral "earth"

3. Compound Elements:
   When these elements appeared in compounds, the final vowel was lost before 
   compounding:
   - *toru-malu > tor-mal > tomal "great pool"
   - *malu-teru > mal-ter > mater "vessel"
```

This pattern is supported by the extensive evidence of final vowel loss seen in 
Early Hick:

```474:484:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md

### Person Terms

1. Basic Terms
   - 'al [ʔal] "person" < Proto-Hick *ʔalu → 'al
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick))
     See: [Political Terms](#political-terms)
   - kir [kir] "body, physical form" < Proto-Hick \*kiru → kir
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
     See: [Body Parts](#body-parts), [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual)
   - sekir [se.kir] "foreigner, stranger" < Proto-Hick \*se-kiru → sekir
```


The null coda rule helps explain why Early Hick shows such consistent patterns of 
final vowel loss and provides a more regular sound change pathway from Proto-Hick 
to Early Hick.
