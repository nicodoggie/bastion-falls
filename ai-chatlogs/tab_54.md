what would be a good weight for henry? typical of an officer in training of his height


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Let me help determine a realistic weight for Henry based on his characteristics:

Given that Henry is:
- 5'6" (168 cm) tall
- A military officer in training
- Described as having a small frame but maintaining military posture
- Living in a setting analogous to Napoleonic-era technology/culture
- 20 years old and active

For a military officer of his height and build in this setting, a healthy and 
realistic weight would be around 140-145 pounds (63.5-66 kg). This would give him 
a BMI of about 22.6-23.4, which is well within the healthy range while reflecting:

1. Military fitness requirements
2. The generally leaner builds common in pre-modern societies
3. Regular physical training and activity
4. Enough mass to maintain authority presence despite shorter stature

Here's how I would update the frontmatter:

```markdown:site/content/characters/henry-surrata-spellvig.md
+++
title = "Henry Surrata-Spellvig"
[extra.cha]
age = "20"
sex = "Male"
pronouns = "he/him"
date_of_birth = "date#1255-04-01"
date_of_death = ""
married_to = ""
married_on = ""
height = "5'6\""
weight = "142 lbs" # Added weight appropriate for military officer of his stature
// ... rest of frontmatter remains unchanged ...
```

This weight would support the description of him being able to maintain a proper 
military bearing while still reflecting his naturally smaller frame.

not definitely not napoleonic era. that was just for the prompt. he's early modern period at the latest, but a member of a cadet branch of a major noble house


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Ah, I apologize for the anachronistic comparison! Let me revise for an 
early modern/medieval noble military context:

For a young noble military officer in training in this period, the weight would 
likely be somewhat lighter, considering:

1. Medieval/early modern diets, even for nobility, were generally less 
   calorie-dense
2. Military training in this period focused more on agility and endurance
3. As a cadet branch member, he'd likely have a less luxurious lifestyle than 
   the main house
4. Historical records suggest people were generally leaner in this period

A more historically appropriate weight would be around 130-135 pounds (59-61 kg). 
This would still maintain his military presence while being more period-accurate.

Here's the update:

```markdown:site/content/characters/henry-surrata-spellvig.md
+++
[extra.cha]
// ... existing attributes ...
height = "5'6\""
weight = "132 lbs" # Added weight appropriate for noble military cadet of his era
// ... rest of frontmatter remains unchanged ...
+++
```

This weight would better reflect his position as a noble military trainee in a 
medieval/early modern setting while maintaining his described physical 
characteristics.
