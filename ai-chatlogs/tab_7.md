[text]  
@lexicon.md @lexicon.jsonld let's add a new semantic field for action words. can you help me copy words to this new section and cross-reference them?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

I'll help analyze the lexicon and identify action-related words that should be tagged with an "Action Terms" semantic field. Looking through the provided excerpts, I notice several words that could be classified as actions. Here's what I suggest:

1. From the existing entries, these words should get "Action Terms" added to their semantic fields:

```jsonld
"thren" - "observation, watching"
"vinuiter" - "to give birth" 
"tak" - "strike, impact"
```

2. For derived verbal forms:
```jsonld
"gnar-'er" - "to be correct"
"kul-'er" - "to perform magic"
```

To implement this, we would add "Action Terms" to their `lexinfo:semanticField` arrays. For example:

```jsonld
"lexinfo:semanticField": [
  "Action Terms",
  "Basic Terms"
]
```

For derived forms, since they're under `derivedForms`, we'd need to add semantic field information to their entries.

Would you like me to:
1. Show the full JSON-LD modifications for these entries
2. Suggest additional words that could be classified as actions
3. Create a new section specifically for collecting action terms?

Let me know which approach you'd prefer and I can provide more detailed recommendations.

[text]  
let's add the new markdown section first, then modifications to the ontolex-lemon json-ld


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Here's a draft for the new Action Terms section in markdown:

```markdown
## Action Terms

Early Hick had several key verbs and action-related words that formed the basis for more 
complex verbal expressions. Many of these show the characteristic -'er verbalizer suffix.

### Basic Actions
- _tak_ "strike, impact" (from Proto-Hick *taku)
- _thren_ "watch, observe" 
- _vinuiter_ "to give birth" (from _vinu_ "pregnancy" + _iter_ ELL)

### Derived Actions
- _gnar-'er_ "to be correct" (from _gnar_ + _-'er_ VERB)
- _kul-'er_ "to perform magic" (from _kul_ "magic" + _-'er_ VERB)

### Sacred/Ritual Actions
- _vinuiter_ "to give birth" (considered a sacred act)
- _kul-'er_ "to perform magic" (ritual/sacred context)
```

Now for the JSON-LD modifications, would you like me to show how to add the "Action Terms" 
semantic field to these entries?

## User:


[text]  
yes please


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Here are the JSON-LD modifications to add "Action Terms" to the relevant entries. I'll show 
the changes needed for each entry:

```jsonld
{
  "@id": "eh:vinuiter",
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
  "canonicalForm": {
    "@type": "ontolex:Form",

    "etymon:soundChange": "case lexicalization"
  },
  "sense": [

      "@type": "ontolex:LexicalSense", 
      "definition": {
        "@value": "to give birth",
        "@language": "en"
      },
      "lexinfo:semanticField": [

        "Sacred Terms",
        "Action Terms"  // Added
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

For words with derived forms:

```jsonld
{
  "@id": "eh:gnar",
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
  "canonicalForm": {
    "@type": "ontolex:Form",
    "writtenRep": "gnar",
    "phoneticRep": "gnar"
  },
  "lexicalCategory": "lexinfo:Noun",
  "sense": [

      },
      "lexinfo:semanticField": [

      "grammaticalMeaning": "to be correct",
      "lexinfo:semanticField": ["Action Terms"]  // Added
    }
  ]
}
```

For _kul_ and its derived form:

```jsonld
{
  "@id": "eh:kul",
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
  "canonicalForm": {
    "@type": "ontolex:Form",
    "writtenRep": "kul",

  "lexicalCategory": "lexinfo:Noun",
  "sense": [

      "definition": {
        "@value": "magic, sorcery",
        "@language": "en"
      },
      "lexinfo:semanticField": [
        "Magical Terms",
        "Sacred Terms",
        "Action Terms"  // Added
      ]
    }
  ],
  "derivedForms": [
    {
      "@type": "ontolex:Form", 
      "writtenRep": "kul-'er",
      "phoneticRep": "kul.ʔer",
      "decomposition": "kul + -'er (verbalizer)",
      "grammaticalMeaning": "to perform magic",
      "lexinfo:semanticField": ["Action Terms"]  // Added
    }
  ]
}
```

For _tak_:

```jsonld
{
  "@id": "eh:tak",
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
  "canonicalForm": {
    "@type": "ontolex:Form",
    "writtenRep": "tak",
    "phoneticRep": "tak"
  },
  "sense": [
    {
      "@type": "ontolex:LexicalSense",
      "definition": {
        "@value": "strike, impact",
        "@language": "en"
      },
      "lexinfo:semanticField": [
        "Basic Terms",
        "Action Terms"  // Added
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

These modifications:
1. Add "Action Terms" to existing semantic fields
2. Add semantic fields to derived forms where appropriate
3. Maintain existing relationships and structure
4. Preserve other semantic fields while adding the new category

Would you like me to show how these entries would look in the full context of the lexicon?

## User:


[text]  
looks good


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Great! Just to summarize what we've done:

1. Created a new markdown section organizing action terms into:
   - Basic Actions
   - Derived Actions 
   - Sacred/Ritual Actions

2. Modified the JSON-LD to add "Action Terms" semantic field to:
   - Primary verbs (tak, vinuiter)
   - Words with verbal derivations (gnar, kul)
   - Their derived forms with -'er

The next steps could be:
1. Identify more action words in the lexicon
2. Add more derived forms with -'er
3. Expand the semantic categorization (e.g. movement verbs, speech verbs, etc.)

Would you like to explore any of these next steps?

## User:


[text]  
let's just add the existing words for now into the new section


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Looking through the provided lexicon, here's an expanded markdown section incorporating all 
existing action-related words:

```markdown
## Action Terms

Early Hick had several key verbs and action-related words that formed the basis for more 
complex verbal expressions. Many show the characteristic -'er verbalizer suffix or derive 
from case forms.

### Basic Actions
- _tak_ "strike, impact" (from Proto-Hick *taku)
- _thren_ "watch, observe"
- _murvinuiter_ "to abort" (lit. "from night-birth")
- _vinuiter_ "to give birth" (from _vinu_ "pregnancy" + _iter_ ELL)

### Derived Actions
- _gnar-'er_ "to be correct" (from _gnar_ + _-'er_ VERB)
- _kul-'er_ "to perform magic" (from _kul_ "magic" + _-'er_ VERB)
- _materok_ "to guide vessels" (from _mater_ "vessel" + _-ok_ AGENT)
- _malthrenok_ "to divine through water" (from _mal_ "pool" + _thren_ "watch" + _-ok_ AGENT)

### Sacred/Ritual Actions
- _vinuiter_ "to give birth" (sacred act)
- _kul-'er_ "to perform magic" (ritual context)
- _malthrenok_ "pool-watching divination"
- _imurkulok_ "to practice necromancy" (lit. "evil-magic-doer")
```

This organization shows how Early Hick handled different types of actions through both basic 
roots and derived forms. The -'er and -ok suffixes were particularly productive for creating 
action words.

## User:


[text]  
oh could you copy the existing format established in the markdown document?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Looking at the existing format in the markdown document, here's how the Action Terms section 
should be structured:

```markdown
## Action Terms

Action words in Early Hick show several derivational patterns, particularly the -'er 
verbalizer and -ok agentive suffixes. Many basic actions relate to sacred or ritual 
contexts.

_tak_ "strike, impact"  
From Proto-Hick *taku. Shows onomatopoeic origin. Used in compounds for forceful actions.

_thren_ "watch, observe"  
Forms agent nouns like _malthrenok_ "pool-watcher, diviner".

_vinuiter_ "to give birth"  
From _vinu_ "pregnancy" + _itar_ (ELL). Sacred term for childbirth.

_murvinuiter_ "to abort"  
From _mur_ "night/darkness" + _vinuiter_. Literally "from night-birth".

_gnar-'er_ "to be correct"  
Derived form showing productive -'er verbalizer suffix.

_kul-'er_ "to perform magic"  
From _kul_ "magic" + -'er verbalizer. Used in ritual contexts.

_materok_ "vessel-guide, boatman"  
Agent noun from _mater_ "vessel" + -ok suffix.

_malthrenok_ "pool-watcher, diviner"  
Compound of _mal_ "pool" + _thren_ "watch" + -ok. Sacred occupation.

_imurkulok_ "necromancer"  
From _imur_ "evil" + _kul_ "magic" + -ok. Literally "evil-magic-worker".
```

This follows the established pattern of:
1. Section header
2. Introductory paragraph
3. Individual entries with:
   - Word in italics with gloss
   - Etymology/derivation info
   - Additional usage notes where relevant

## User:


[selections]  
```markdown

- takutak [ˈta.ku.tək] "rhythm" < Proto-Hick \*takutaku → takutak
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Preserves onomatopoeic reduplication
```
[text]  
should be something like this


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Ah yes, you're right! Here's the Action Terms section formatted to match the existing style:

```markdown
## Action Terms

- tak [tak] "strike, impact" < Proto-Hick *taku → tak 
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Onomatopoeic origin

- thren [θren] "watch, observe" < Proto-Hick *threnu → thren
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Forms agent nouns like malthrenok "diviner"

- vinuiter [vi.nu.i.ter] "to give birth" < vinu + itar (ELL) → vinuiter
  ([case lexicalization](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Sacred term for childbirth

- murvinuiter [mur.vi.nu.i.ter] "to abort" < mur + vinuiter → murvinuiter
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Literally "from night-birth"

- kul'er [kul.ʔer] "to perform magic" < kul + -'er → kul'er
  ([verbalizer suffix](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Used in ritual contexts

- materok [ma.te.rok] "vessel-guide" < mater + -ok → materok
  ([agentive suffix](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Maritime occupation term

- malthrenok [mal.θre.nok] "pool-watcher, diviner" < mal + thren + -ok → malthrenok
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Sacred occupation term

- imurkulok [i.mur.ku.lok] "necromancer" < imur + kul + -ok → imurkulok
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Literally "evil-magic-worker"
```

This matches the format with:
- Word [IPA] "gloss" < etymology → result
- Sound change link in parentheses
- Note with additional information

## User:


[text]  
better, are there more?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Let me check the lexicon for any other action-related words we might have missed. Looking 
through the JSON-LD data:

```markdown
- 'aker [ʔa.ker] "how (visible/known manner)" < 'aka + 'er + is → 'aker
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Shows verbal interrogative with -'er suffix

- 'akereth [ʔa.ke.reθ] "how (sensed manner)" < 'aka + 'er + eth → 'akereth
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Medial distance verbal interrogative

- 'akerum [ʔa.ke.rum] "how (unknown manner)" < 'aka + 'er + um → 'akerum
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Distal verbal interrogative
```

These show the verbal interrogative forms with the -'er suffix. Are there any other 
categories of words we should examine for potential action terms? For example:
1. Words with the -'er verbalizer
2. Agent nouns with -ok
3. Case-derived verbs like vinuiter

Would you like me to look for more examples in any of these categories?

## User:


[text]  
I don't think the agent words should be here. they aren't semantically action words, instead refer to entities


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Ah, you're absolutely right! Let me revise the Action Terms section by removing the agent 
nouns and focusing only on true action words:

```markdown
## Action Terms

- tak [tak] "strike, impact" < Proto-Hick *taku → tak 
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Onomatopoeic origin

- thren [θren] "watch, observe" < Proto-Hick *threnu → thren
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Basic perception verb

- vinuiter [vi.nu.i.ter] "to give birth" < vinu + itar (ELL) → vinuiter
  ([case lexicalization](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Sacred term for childbirth

- murvinuiter [mur.vi.nu.i.ter] "to abort" < mur + vinuiter → murvinuiter
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Literally "from night-birth"

- kul'er [kul.ʔer] "to perform magic" < kul + -'er → kul'er
  ([verbalizer suffix](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Used in ritual contexts
```

I've removed:
- materok (agent noun "vessel-guide")
- malthrenok (agent noun "pool-watcher")
- imurkulok (agent noun "necromancer")

This makes the section more focused on actual verbs and action words. Should we continue 
looking for other true action words in the lexicon?

## User:


[text]  
are there other words in the current lexicon that you think have meaning that refer to actions? for example you didn't add the word for sight


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Let me check the lexicon carefully for any words that semantically denote actions, including 
perceptual verbs and similar concepts...

Looking through the provided JSON-LD data, I don't actually see a separate word for "sight" 
that's distinct from _thren_ "watch, observe" in the current lexicon. However, this is a 
good reminder that we should be thorough in identifying action meanings.

Let me scan through the lexicon again to be absolutely certain we haven't missed any action 
words. We're looking for:
1. Explicit verbs
2. Words that denote actions even if not morphologically marked as verbs
3. Words whose primary sense involves doing something

Would you like me to do another careful pass through the lexicon data to find any we might 
have missed?

## User:


[text]  
all three please


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):





Let me do a careful analysis through the lexicon data for all three categories:

1. Explicit verbs (morphologically marked):
```markdown
- vinuiter [vi.nu.i.ter] "to give birth" < vinu + itar (ELL) → vinuiter
  ([case lexicalization](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Sacred term for childbirth

- murvinuiter [mur.vi.nu.i.ter] "to abort" < mur + vinuiter → murvinuiter
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Literally "from night-birth"

- kul'er [kul.ʔer] "to perform magic" < kul + -'er → kul'er
  ([verbalizer suffix](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Used in ritual contexts
```

2. Words denoting actions (even if not morphologically verbal):
```markdown
- tak [tak] "strike, impact" < Proto-Hick *taku → tak 
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Onomatopoeic origin

- thren [θren] "watch, observe" < Proto-Hick *threnu → thren
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Basic perception verb
```

3. Words with primary action sense:
```markdown
- sibris [si.bris] "love" < Proto-Hick *hibrisu → sibris
  ([initial fricative change](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Metaphorical extension from 'fire' to emotional action
```

Would you like me to:
1. Add these all to the Action Terms section?
2. Look for any other potential candidates?
3. Organize them by subcategories (e.g. physical actions, emotional actions, etc.)?

## User:


[text]  
2 and 3 please


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Let me do another careful pass through the lexicon and then organize by semantic 
subcategories...

Looking at the full lexicon data, here's what I found organized by type:

```markdown
## Action Terms

### Physical Actions
- tak [tak] "strike, impact" < Proto-Hick *taku → tak 
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Onomatopoeic origin

### Perceptual Actions
- thren [θren] "watch, observe" < Proto-Hick *threnu → thren
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Basic perception verb

### Bodily/Life Actions
- vinuiter [vi.nu.i.ter] "to give birth" < vinu + itar (ELL) → vinuiter
  ([case lexicalization](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Sacred term for childbirth

- murvinuiter [mur.vi.nu.i.ter] "to abort" < mur + vinuiter → murvinuiter
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Literally "from night-birth"

### Magical/Sacred Actions  
- kul'er [kul.ʔer] "to perform magic" < kul + -'er → kul'er
  ([verbalizer suffix](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Used in ritual contexts

### Emotional/Mental Actions
- sibris [si.bris] "love" < Proto-Hick *hibrisu → sibris
  ([initial fricative change](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Metaphorical extension from 'fire' to emotional action
```

Additional potential candidates I found that might be considered action-related:

1. Words with potential action senses:
   - _mes_ "heart" (might have verbal uses for emotional actions?)
   - _thil_ "virtue, moral" (might imply action/behavior?)

2. Compounds that might imply actions:
   - Any compounds with _tak_ "strike"
   - Any compounds with _thren_ "watch"

Would you like me to:
1. Research these potential candidates further?
2. Adjust the categorization?
3. Look for any other patterns that might suggest action meanings?

[text]  
let's add a word barak to mean "walking"


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



I'll help add "barak" for "walking" to both the lexicon.jsonld and the markdown. First, 
let's add it to the JSON-LD:

```jsonld
{
  "@id": "eh:barak",
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
  "canonicalForm": {
    "@type": "ontolex:Form",
    "writtenRep": "barak",
    "phoneticRep": "ba.rak"
  },
  "lexicalCategory": "lexinfo:Verb",
  "etymology": {
    "@type": "etymon:Etymology",
    "etymon:protoform": "Proto-Hick *baraku",
    "etymon:soundChange": "final vowel loss"
  },
  "sense": [
    {
      "@type": "ontolex:LexicalSense",
      "definition": {
        "@value": "to walk",
        "@language": "en"
      },
      "lexinfo:semanticField": [
        "Action Terms",
        "Motion Terms"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

And in the markdown Action Terms section:

```markdown
### Motion Actions
- barak [ba.rak] "to walk" < Proto-Hick *baraku → barak
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Basic motion verb
```

I added it under a new "Motion Actions" subcategory since it's our first motion verb. Would 
you like me to:
1. Add more motion-related terms?
2. Adjust the etymology or definition?
3. Consider potential compounds or derivations?

## User:


[text]  
barak in itself is not yet a verb. we default to a nominal form typically and add 'er as a verbalizer, even for words whose primary semantic sense is motion/action


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):





Ah, you're absolutely right - I apologize for that assumption. Let me correct both entries 
to reflect the nominal base form with the verbal derivation:

```jsonld
{
  "@id": "eh:barak",
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
  "canonicalForm": {
    "@type": "ontolex:Form",
    "writtenRep": "barak",
    "phoneticRep": "ba.rak"
  },
  "lexicalCategory": "lexinfo:Noun",
  "etymology": {
    "@type": "etymon:Etymology",
    "etymon:protoform": "Proto-Hick *baraku",
    "etymon:soundChange": "final vowel loss"
  },
  "sense": [
    {
      "@type": "ontolex:LexicalSense",
      "definition": {
        "@value": "walking, gait",
        "@language": "en"
      },
      "lexinfo:semanticField": [
        "Motion Terms",
        "Action Terms"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "derivedForms": [
    {
      "@type": "ontolex:Form",
      "writtenRep": "barak'er",
      "phoneticRep": "ba.rak.ʔer",
      "decomposition": "barak + -'er (verbalizer)",
      "grammaticalMeaning": "to walk"
    }
  ]
}
```


And in the markdown:

```markdown
### Motion Actions
- barak [ba.rak] "walking, gait" < Proto-Hick *baraku → barak
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Forms verb barak'er "to walk" with -'er suffix
```


This better reflects the pattern where:
1. The base form is nominal
2. The -'er suffix creates the verbal form
3. The semantic domain is motion/action regardless of word class

Would you like me to revise any other entries to better reflect this pattern?

```jsonld
{
  "@id": "eh:vinud",
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
  "canonicalForm": {
    "@type": "ontolex:Form",
    "writtenRep": "vinud",
    "phoneticRep": "vi.nud"
  },
  "lexicalCategory": "lexinfo:Noun",
  "etymology": {
    "@type": "etymon:Etymology",
    "etymon:protoform": "Proto-Hick *venu-wudu",
    "etymon:components": [
      "venu (burden)",
      "wudu (wood)"
    ],
    "etymon:soundChange": [
      "compound fusion",
      "final vowel loss"
    ],
    "etymon:note": "Semantic shift from 'wood structure' to 'dwelling'"
  },
  "sense": [
    {
      "@type": "ontolex:LexicalSense",
      "definition": {
        "@value": "building, dwelling",
        "@language": "en"
      },
      "lexinfo:semanticField": [
        "Structure Terms",
        "Basic Terms"

      "@type": "ontolex:Form",
      "writtenRep": "vinud'er",
      "phoneticRep": "vi.nu.dʔer",
      "decomposition": "vinud + -'er (verbalizer)",
      "grammaticalMeaning": "to build, to dwell"
    }
  ]
}
```


And in the markdown Action Terms section:

```markdown
### Construction/Dwelling Actions
- vinud [vi.nud] "building, dwelling" < Proto-Hick *venu-wudu → vinud
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: From 'burden' + 'wood', forms verb vinud'er "to build, to dwell"
```


I've:
1. Created the compound etymology from *venu and *wudu
2. Added sound changes for compound fusion and final vowel loss
3. Included the verbal derivation with -'er
4. Created a new subcategory for construction/dwelling actions

Would you like me to:
1. Adjust any of these details?
2. Add more related terms?
3. Reorganize the categories?

## User:


[text]  
aside from action terms what other semantic fields would you recommend?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Looking at the existing lexicon and common semantic domains in languages, here are 
recommended semantic fields:

```markdown
## Semantic Fields in Early Hick

### Natural World
- Elements (al "rock", gral "earth", ai "water")
- Celestial (thrakel "sun", murkel "night sky")
- Landforms (tor "peak", val "valley")
- Weather/Climate
- Flora/Fauna

### Sacred & Spiritual
- Ritual Terms
- Divine Entities
- Sacred Places
- Magic/Power (kul "magic")

### Body & Life
- Body Parts (mes "heart")
- Kinship (bao "father", nai "mother")
- Life Stages
- Health/Illness

### Built World
- Structures (vinud "building")
- Tools/Implements
- Materials
- Crafts

### Abstract Concepts
- Emotions (sibris "love")
- Virtues (thil "virtue")
- Time Terms (tel "time")
- Numbers/Quantity

### Social World
- Status/Roles
- Occupations
- Community Terms
- Property/Possession

### Spatial/Location
- Directions
- Distance
- Position
- Movement Terms (barak "walking")

### Descriptive
- Colors (kel "blue")
- Physical Properties
- States/Conditions
- Qualities
```

Would you like me to:
1. Expand any of these categories?
2. Add example words from the lexicon to each?
3. Organize them differently?

## User:


[text]  
what I mean to say is, where else do you recommend to place venud in?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):





Ah! Looking at _vinud_ "building, dwelling", I'd recommend placing it in these semantic 
fields:

1. Structure Terms (primary category - it's a building)
2. Settlement Terms (it relates to habitation)
3. Basic Terms (it's a fundamental concept)

So in the JSON-LD, it would look like:

```jsonld
"sense": [
  {
    "@type": "ontolex:LexicalSense",
    "definition": {
      "@value": "building, dwelling",
      "@language": "en"
    },
    "lexinfo:semanticField": [
      "Structure Terms",
      "Settlement Terms",
      "Basic Terms"
    ]
  }
]
```


This captures:
- Its physical nature as a structure
- Its social function as a dwelling
- Its status as a basic vocabulary item

Would you like me to:
1. Show where it would fit in the markdown sections for these fields?
2. Suggest any other potential semantic fields?
3. Look for related words that might share these fields?

  Note: Shows archaic animacy prefix, forms verb 'irek'er "to stand"
```



I've:
1. Added the animacy marker etymology
2. Included both position and action semantic fields
3. Created a new subcategory for position/stance actions
4. Added the verbal derivation with -'er

Would you like me to:
1. Adjust any details?
2. Add related terms?

lisu actually is a root related to sight


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):









Ah, thank you for the correction! Let me revise the etymology to reflect the connection to 
sight:

```jsonld
{
  "@id": "eh:'ilis",
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
  "canonicalForm": {
    "@type": "ontolex:Form",

      "decomposition": "'ilis + -'er (verbalizer)",
      "grammaticalMeaning": "to know"
    }
  ]
}
```





And in the markdown:

```markdown
### Mental/Perceptual Actions
- 'ilis [ʔi.lis] "knowledge" < Proto-Hick *hi-lisu → 'ilis
  ([initial fricative change](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: From root meaning 'sight', forms verb 'ilis'er "to know"
```





Changes made:
1. Updated etymology to show *lisu means "sight"
2. Added note about semantic extension from sight to knowledge
3. Added "Perception Terms" to semantic fields
4. Combined Mental/Perceptual in the action category

Would you like me to:
1. Explore other sight-related terms?
2. Adjust the semantic categorization?
3. Look for similar perception-to-cognition patterns?

 let's add gras'er as to graze, from gras meaning grass


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):









I'll add _gras_ and its verbal derivation to both formats:

  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Forms verb gras'er "to graze", typically of animals feeding
```





I've:
1. Added basic noun etymology from Proto-Hick
2. Created a new "Consumption Actions" subcategory
3. Added the verbal derivation with -'er
4. Included relevant semantic fields

Would you like me to:
1. Adjust any details?
2. Add related terms?
3. Reorganize the categories?

## User:


[text]  
I think we may want to add Pastoral Terms to our semantic fields


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):





Yes! Let's add Pastoral Terms as a semantic field and update _gras_ to include it:

```jsonld
{
  "@id": "eh:gras",
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
  // ... other fields same as before ...
  "sense": [
    {
      "@type": "ontolex:LexicalSense",
      "definition": {
        "@value": "grass",
        "@language": "en"
      },
      "lexinfo:semanticField": [
        "Plant Terms",
        "Natural World",
        "Pastoral Terms",  // Added
        "Basic Terms"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Other words that might belong in Pastoral Terms could include:
1. Animal husbandry terms
2. Grazing/feeding terms
3. Herd/flock terms
4. Seasonal movement terms
5. Land use terms

Would you like me to:
1. Look for existing words that should be tagged with Pastoral Terms?
2. Suggest some new pastoral-related vocabulary?
3. Create a dedicated section for Pastoral Terms in the markdown?

## User:


[text]  
let's see existing words that may fit into this new field please


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):





Let me scan through the provided lexicon for words that might fit into Pastoral Terms. 
Looking at the semantic domains and definitions:

1. Definitely Pastoral:
- _gras_ "grass" - fundamental to grazing and pasturage
- _gras'er_ "to graze" - basic pastoral activity

2. Potentially Pastoral (based on context):
- _gral_ "earth, soil" - could relate to grazing lands
- _thragral_ "sacred earth" - might relate to pastoral sacred spaces
- _val_ "valley" - often important for pastoral activities

3. Indirectly Related:
- _barak_ "walking, gait" - might relate to herd movement
- _'irek_ "stand, firmness" - might relate to animal posture/behavior

Would you like me to:
1. Show how to add the Pastoral Terms field to these entries?
2. Look for more potential connections?
3. Create a hierarchy of pastoral-related terms?

Note: I'm being conservative in these suggestions since we should be careful about 
over-attributing pastoral significance without clear evidence.

## User:


[text]  
let's just add the definitely pastoral stuff


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):







Yes, let's be conservative and only add the Pastoral Terms field to the clearly pastoral 
words. Here are the updates:

```jsonld
{
  "@id": "eh:gras",
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
  "canonicalForm": {
    "@type": "ontolex:Form",
    "writtenRep": "gras",
    "phoneticRep": "gras"
  },
  "lexicalCategory": "lexinfo:Noun",
  "etymology": {
    "@type": "etymon:Etymology",
    "etymon:protoform": "Proto-Hick *grasu",
    "etymon:soundChange": "final vowel loss"
  },
  "sense": [
    {
      "@type": "ontolex:LexicalSense",
      "definition": {
        "@value": "grass",
        "@language": "en"
      },
      "lexinfo:semanticField": [
        "Plant Terms",
        "Natural World",
        "Pastoral Terms",
        "Basic Terms"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "derivedForms": [
    {
      "@type": "ontolex:Form",
      "writtenRep": "gras'er",
      "phoneticRep": "gras.ʔer",
      "decomposition": "gras + -'er (verbalizer)",
      "grammaticalMeaning": "to graze"
    }
  ]
}
```

This keeps us focused on the clear pastoral connections without overextending the semantic 
field. As we add more vocabulary related to herding, animal husbandry, and pastoral life, 
we can expand this category.

Would you like to:
1. Add any new pastoral terms?
2. Create a dedicated section for pastoral vocabulary?
3. Look for compounds with _gras_?

## User:


[text]  
let's create the Pastoral Terms section into the markdown doc first, with the relevant cross-references


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):







Here's the new Pastoral Terms section for the markdown document:

```markdown
## Pastoral Terms

- gras [gras] "grass" < Proto-Hick *grasu → gras
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Basic pastoral term, forms verb gras'er "to graze". See also [Action Terms](#action-terms)
```

The section is currently small but structured to:
1. Show the basic pastoral vocabulary
2. Cross-reference to other relevant sections (like Action Terms)
3. Follow the established format for entries

Would you like to:
1. Add more cross-references?
2. Create subsections for different types of pastoral terms?
3. Add notes about pastoral cultural context?

## User:


[text]  
would it be natural to have grasiter from grass + archaic ELL to mean to herd?  to compare to current gras'er to graze?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):











That's an interesting suggestion! Having both forms would show different derivational 
patterns and semantic nuances. Let's add it:

```jsonld
{
  "@id": "eh:gras",
  // ... existing entries ...
  "derivedForms": [
    {
      "@type": "ontolex:Form",
      "writtenRep": "gras'er",
      "phoneticRep": "gras.ʔer",
      "decomposition": "gras + -'er (verbalizer)",
      "grammaticalMeaning": "to graze"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ontolex:Form",
      "writtenRep": "grasiter",
      "phoneticRep": "gra.si.ter",
      "decomposition": "gras + itar (ELL)",
      "grammaticalMeaning": "to herd, to lead to pasture"
    }
  ]
}
```





And in the markdown:

```markdown
## Pastoral Terms

- gras [gras] "grass" < Proto-Hick *grasu → gras
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Basic pastoral term. Forms two verbs:
  - gras'er "to graze" (animal eating grass)
  - grasiter "to herd, lead to pasture" (person leading animals)
  See also [Action Terms](#action-terms)
```





This shows:
1. Different derivational patterns (-'er vs -iter)
2. Semantic distinction (animal action vs human action)
3. Preservation of archaic case form in specialized meaning

Would you like me to:
1. Add these distinctions to the Action Terms section too?
2. Explore other potential -iter formations?
3. Add more detail about the semantic differences?

## User:


[text]  
would it be more natural instead to do grasaes with the illative? because I think of herding taking in grazing animals


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):













Ah yes, that's a really good point! The illative would better capture the sense of "taking 
in" or "bringing into" grazing. Let me revise:

```jsonld
{
  "@id": "eh:gras",
  // ... existing entries ...
  "derivedForms": [
    {
      "@type": "ontolex:Form",
      "writtenRep": "gras'er",
      "phoneticRep": "gras.ʔer",
      "decomposition": "gras + -'er (verbalizer)",
      "grammaticalMeaning": "to graze"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ontolex:Form",
      "writtenRep": "grasaes",
      "phoneticRep": "gra.sa.es",
      "decomposition": "gras + aes (ILL)",
      "grammaticalMeaning": "to herd, to take (animals) to graze"
    }
  ]
}
```






And in the markdown:

```markdown
## Pastoral Terms

- gras [gras] "grass" < Proto-Hick *grasu → gras
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Basic pastoral term. Forms two verbs:
  - gras'er "to graze" (animal eating grass)
  - grasaes "to herd, take to graze" (from illative: 'into grazing')
  See also [Action Terms](#action-terms)
```






This better reflects:
1. The semantic notion of "taking into" grazing
2. The use of illative rather than ellative
3. The distinction between animal action and herder action

Would you like me to:
1. Add this to the Action Terms section?
2. Look for other potential illative formations?
3. Add more detail about the semantic distinction?

```






I've:
1. Added it to the Consumption Actions subcategory (with _gras_)
2. Included basic etymology
3. Added relevant semantic fields
4. Added the verbal derivation with -'er

Would you like me to:
1. Adjust any details?

[text]  
I think we should just add ter'er specifically as a consumption term. flow using ter can be done by using directional affixes.


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):















Ah, I see! So _ter'er_ specifically developed for consumption while flow/motion uses of 
_ter_ take directional affixes. Let me revise:

}
```







And in the markdown Action Terms section:

```markdown

  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Forms verb ter'er "to drink". Flow meanings use directional affixes instead
```







Changes made:
1. Kept _ter_ as "flow, fluid motion"
2. Specified _ter'er_ specifically for "drink"
3. Added note about directional affixes for flow meanings
4. Placed _ter'er_ with other consumption verbs

Would you like me to:
1. Add examples with directional affixes?
2. Look for other consumption terms?

btw we already have sin as the number one. they're homonyms. how do we fix that in the @lexicon.jsonld ?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):











Ah yes, we need to distinguish between these homonyms. We can modify the floating _sin_ by 
giving it a separate ID and keeping both entries:

```jsonld
{
  "@id": "eh:sin_num",  // Existing entry for "one"
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
  "canonicalForm": {
    "@type": "ontolex:Form",

    "phoneticRep": "sin"
  },
  "lexicalCategory": "lexinfo:Numeral",
  "etymology": {
    "@type": "etymon:Etymology",
    "etymon:protoform": "Proto-Hick *su-inu",
    "etymon:note": "From counting form with *-inu suffix",
    "etymon:soundChange": "final vowel loss"
  },
  "sense": [
    {
      "@type": "ontolex:LexicalSense",

        "@language": "en"
      },
      "lexinfo:semanticField": "Number System"
    }
  ]
},
{
  "@id": "eh:sin_float",  // New entry for "floating"
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
  "canonicalForm": {
    "@type": "ontolex:Form",
    "writtenRep": "sin",
    "phoneticRep": "sin"
  },
  "lexicalCategory": "lexinfo:Noun",
  "etymology": {
    "@type": "etymon:Etymology",
    "etymon:protoform": "Proto-Hick *senu",
    "etymon:soundChange": "final vowel loss"
  },
  "sense": [
    {
      "@type": "ontolex:LexicalSense",
      "definition": {
        "@value": "floating",
        "@language": "en"
      },
      "lexinfo:semanticField": [
        "Motion Terms",
        "Maritime Terms",
        "Action Terms"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "derivedForms": [
    {
      "@type": "ontolex:Form",
      "writtenRep": "sin'er",
      "phoneticRep": "sin.ʔer",
      "decomposition": "sin + -'er (verbalizer)",
      "grammaticalMeaning": "to float"
    }
  ]
}
```

The key changes are:
1. Different @id values (_sin_num_ vs _sin_float_)
2. Different lexical categories (Numeral vs Noun)
3. Different etymologies (*su-inu vs *senu)
4. Different semantic fields

Would you like me to:
1. Add homonym cross-references?
2. Update any related entries?
3. Add usage notes about the homonymy?

## User:


[text]  
1 and 2 please


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):













I'll add homonym cross-references and update related entries:

```jsonld
{
  "@id": "eh:sin_num",
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
  // ... existing fields ...
  "sense": [
    {
      "@type": "ontolex:LexicalSense",

    }
  ],
  "related": [
    {
      "@id": "eh:sin_num",
      "type": "lexinfo:homonym"
    }
  ]
}
```

And for any compounds or derived forms that use _sin_, we should specify which one:

```jsonld
{
  "@id": "eh:sinai",  // Example compound "floating water"
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
  "decomp:subterm": [
    {
      "@id": "eh:sin_float"  // Specifically references the float meaning
    },
    {
      "@id": "eh:ai"
    }
  ]
}
```

Would you like me to:
1. Look for any existing compounds using _sin_ that need updating?
2. Add more cross-references?
3. Add usage notes about contexts where they might be distinguished?
