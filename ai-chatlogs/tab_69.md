[text]  
We want to reintroduce missing past and future tense markers for the Early Hick grammar in @_index.md . that was discussed in @Lexicon Consistency and Rule Violation Analysis.md . branum for past from bran (dawn) + um the out of sight distal demonstrative marker. can you tease out that conversation and complete the Tense Marking section for early hick?


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):

Yes! Looking at the conversation, let's document the tense marking system that emerged. Here's how we should add it to _index.md:

````markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
### Tense Marking

1. Basic Temporal Markers
   - branum [bra.num] "past" (lit. "swift-that.DIST.INAN")
     - From bran "swift/passing" + -um "distal inanimate"
     - Conceptualizes past as distant/unseen time
   - branrum [bran.rum] "ancestral time" (lit. "swift-that.DIST.ANIM")
     - Uses animate distal marker for sacred/ancestral time
   
2. Completive Marking
   - tel [tel] "complete, finished"
     - Follows clause for past perfect meaning
     - Example: bramisimris keth branum tel
       "the river had flowed to the sea"

3. Position and Usage
   - Can occur sentence-initial (topic/focus):
     - branum bramisimris keth
       "In the past, the river flowed to the sea"
   - Can occur sentence-final (neutral):
     - bramisimris keth branum
       "The river flowed to the sea"
   - Can occur pre-verbal (emphasis):
     - bramisimris branum keth
       "The river USED TO flow to sea"
````

Would you like me to:
1. Add more examples of usage?
2. Detail other temporal markers?
3. Show how this interacts with other grammatical systems?

The key features captured here are:
- Demonstrative origin of tense markers
- Animate/inanimate distinction in temporal reference
- Flexible positioning for pragmatic effect
- Completive aspect marking with tel

## User:


[text]  
we also had a future tense marker as well?


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):

Looking back at the conversation, I don't actually see a future tense marker being discussed. We covered:

1. Past tense: branum (bran + um)
2. Ancestral/distant past: branrum (bran + rum)
3. Completive aspect: tel

Would you like me to:
1. Propose a future tense marker following similar patterns?
2. Look for any other temporal markers in the documentation?
3. Continue with the existing tense marking section?

The system currently shows a focus on past events, which makes sense for a language preserved mainly in historical and sacred contexts. But let me know if you recall a future marker that I might have missed.

## User:


[text]  
something that started as mulsimrum "changes to a distant night?". then reduced as it grammaticalized


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):



Ah yes! Let me update the Tense Marking section to include this grammaticalized future marker:

`````markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
### Tense Marking

1. Basic Temporal Markers
   - branum [bra.num] "past" (lit. "swift-that.DIST.INAN")
     - From bran "swift/passing" + -um "distal inanimate"
     - Conceptualizes past as distant/unseen time
   - branrum [bran.rum] "ancestral time" (lit. "swift-that.DIST.ANIM")
     - Uses animate distal marker for sacred/ancestral time
   - mulsum [mul.sum] "future" (lit. "night-change-DIST")
     - From mulsimrum "changes to a distant night"
     - Grammaticalized through reduction: mulsimrum → mulsum
   
2. Completive Marking
   - tel [tel] "complete, finished"
     - Follows clause for past perfect meaning
     - Example: bramisimris keth branum tel
       "the river had flowed to the sea"

3. Position and Usage
   - Can occur sentence-initial (topic/focus):
     - branum bramisimris keth
       "In the past, the river flowed to the sea"
     - mulsum bramisimris keth
       "In the future, the river will flow to the sea"
   - Can occur sentence-final (neutral):
     - bramisimris keth branum
       "The river flowed to the sea"
     - bramisimris keth mulsum
       "The river will flow to the sea"
   - Can occur pre-verbal (emphasis):
     - bramisimris branum keth
       "The river USED TO flow to sea"
     - bramisimris mulsum keth
       "The river WILL flow to sea"
`````

Would you like me to:
1. Add more examples with mulsum?
2. Show how it interacts with other aspects?
3. Document the full grammaticalization path?

The key addition here is showing how mulsum developed from a more complex expression about change and night, paralleling how branum developed from concepts of swiftness and distance.

## User:


[text]  
I wonder if "branum bramisimris keth" should be "branum bramisimris kethes"


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):



Ah yes! Since we have an ERG/ABS case system, and "river" is the subject of an intransitive verb ("flow"), it should be marked with absolutive case (-es). Let me correct the examples:

`````markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
### Tense Marking

1. Basic Temporal Markers
   - branum [bra.num] "past" (lit. "swift-that.DIST.INAN")
     - From bran "swift/passing" + -um "distal inanimate"
     - Conceptualizes past as distant/unseen time
   - branrum [bran.rum] "ancestral time" (lit. "swift-that.DIST.ANIM")
     - Uses animate distal marker for sacred/ancestral time
   - mulsum [mul.sum] "future" (lit. "night-change-DIST")
     - From mulsimrum "changes to a distant night"
     - Grammaticalized through reduction: mulsimrum → mulsum
   
2. Completive Marking
   - tel [tel] "complete, finished"
     - Follows clause for past perfect meaning
     - Example: bramisimris kethes branum tel
       "the river had flowed to the sea"

3. Position and Usage
   - Can occur sentence-initial (topic/focus):
     - branum bramisimris kethes
       "In the past, the river flowed to the sea"
     - mulsum bramisimris kethes
       "In the future, the river will flow to the sea"
   - Can occur sentence-final (neutral):
     - bramisimris kethes branum
       "The river flowed to the sea"
     - bramisimris kethes mulsum
       "The river will flow to the sea"
   - Can occur pre-verbal (emphasis):
     - bramisimris branum kethes
       "The river USED TO flow to sea"
     - bramisimris mulsum kethes
       "The river WILL flow to sea"
`````

Would you like me to:
1. Add more examples showing case marking?
2. Show how case interacts with different verb types?
3. Document other grammatical interactions?

The key correction here is properly marking absolutive case on "sea" (kethes) in all examples, as it's the object of an intransitive motion verb.

## User:


[text]  
I'm adding a Speed Augmentative that marks that an agent is moving more swiftly.
would a circumfix tor-<agent>-sim be naturalistic? 


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):

A circumfix for speed augmentative is naturalistic, but let's analyze the components and formation:

1. tor- is already established as an augmentative meaning "great/mighty"
2. -sim appears to relate to motion/direction (as in -imris "through")

A few considerations:
1. Circumfixes often evolve from independent words or combinations of prefixes/suffixes
2. The placement interrupting the agent might be unusual
3. We might want to consider if it would be more natural as:
   - tor-sim-<agent>
   - <agent>-tor-sim
   - sim-<agent>-tor

Would you like me to:
1. Explore possible etymologies for this construction?
2. Look at how it might have grammaticalized?
3. Consider alternative formations that might be more naturalistic?

The key question is: what's the historical source of this speed marking and how did it develop into its current form?

## User:


[text]  
-sim is the translative, actually


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):



Ah! That makes more sense - the translative case marking transformation/becoming. So tor-<agent>-sim would mean something like "becoming a great/mighty agent" > "agent moving swiftly/powerfully".

This is actually quite naturalistic because:
1. tor- is an established augmentative prefix
2. -sim is the established translative case
3. The circumfix captures the idea of "transformation into a greater state"

For example:
- tor-materok-sim "boatman moving swiftly" (lit. "becoming a great boatman")
- tor-threner-sim "watcher moving swiftly" (lit. "becoming a great watcher")

Would you like me to:
1. Document this in the morphology section?
2. Explore more examples?
3. Show how it interacts with other grammatical features?

The grammaticalization path (augmentative + translative > speed marker) is quite natural, similar to how many languages develop manner markers from state changes.

## User:


[text]  
how would a circumfix be marked in interlinear glosses?


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):



In interlinear glosses, circumfixes are typically marked with angle brackets < > around the base, with both parts of the circumfix labeled with the same gloss. For example:

```
tor-materok-sim
AUG<materok>TRANS
"boatman moving swiftly"

tor-threner-sim
AUG<threner>TRANS
"watcher moving swiftly"
```

Or if we want to be more specific about it being a speed augmentative:
```
tor-materok-sim
SWIFT<materok>SWIFT
"boatman moving swiftly"
```

Would you like me to:
1. Show more examples with different glossing conventions?
2. Document this in the grammar with proper glossing?
3. Show how it interacts with other morphological processes in glossed examples?

The key is that the < > notation shows that both parts of the gloss apply to the enclosed base form as a single morphological unit.

## User:


[text]  
let's explore implications on sentences with verbals where speed is not necessarily a factor.
what would this mean?
torthreloksimes threnʔer threnimrisel
SWIFT<threlok>SWIFT.ERG thren.VERB thren.ELL.ABS
I'm thinking it could mean "with great intensity, the watcher watches the watched"

which does raise some questions:
1. can the speed augmentative be used this way?
2. is it natural that an ellative can be used to do what I did there?


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):



These are excellent questions! Let's analyze both:

1. Speed Augmentative as Intensity Marker:
- This is actually quite naturalistic! Many languages extend physical speed/motion markers to intensity of action
- Compare English "swift justice" or "quick to anger" where speed terms mark intensity
- The development would be:
  physical speed > general intensity > emotional/mental intensity
- So "tor-threlok-sim" could indeed mean "with great intensity/vigilance"

2. Ellative as Object of Watching:
- Using a motion-from case to mark the target of perception is less common
- More typical patterns would be:
  - Allative ("towards"): watching TO something
  - Absolutive: direct perception
  - Dative: directing attention TO
- The ellative suggests "watching FROM" which feels less natural

Would you like me to:
1. Propose alternative case marking for perception verbs?
2. Explore other uses of the speed/intensity augmentative?
3. Show how other languages mark similar concepts?

I think the intensity meaning works well, but we might want to reconsider the case marking on the object of perception.

## User:


[text]  
ahh then would an illative work better? I'm a bit wary of adding more cases, if senses of existing cases can be extended

torthreloksimes threnʔer threnaesel
SWIFT<threlok>SWIFT.ERG thren.VERB thren.ILL.ABS


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):



Yes! The illative (-im "into") makes more semantic sense for perception verbs - the idea of "looking INTO something" is quite natural and appears in many languages. It's a good example of extending an existing spatial case rather than creating a new one.

So the sentence would mean:
`````
torthreloksimes threnʔer threnaesel
SWIFT<threlok>SWIFT.ERG thren.VERB thren.ILL.ABS
"With great intensity, the watcher looks into the watched"
`````

This works well because:
1. Illative marking for perception is cross-linguistically common
   - Compare Finnish illative with perception verbs
   - English "look into", "peer into"
2. It maintains the existing case system without adding complexity
3. The metaphorical extension from spatial "into" to perception is natural

Would you like me to:
1. Document this usage pattern for perception verbs?
2. Explore other metaphorical extensions of spatial cases?
3. Show how it interacts with other verb types?

## User:


[text]  
document first, then let's explore the metaphorical extensions


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):



Let me help document this pattern first:

`````markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
### Case Extensions with Perception Verbs

1. Illative with Perception
   - -im marks the target of perception verbs
   - Extends spatial "into" → mental "perceiving into"
   Examples:
   - thren-im "to look into" (watch-ILL)
   - threlok-el keth-im threnʔer
     watcher-ERG sea-ILL watch.VERB
     "The watcher looks into the sea"

2. Speed Augmentative as Intensity
   - tor-<agent>-sim marks intensity of action
   - Extends physical speed → mental/emotional intensity
   Examples:
   - tor-threlok-sim-es threnʔer thren-im-el
     SWIFT<watcher>SWIFT-ERG watch.VERB watch-ILL-ABS
     "With great intensity, the watcher looks into the watched"
`````

Now for metaphorical extensions of spatial cases, would you like me to explore:
1. Other perception/cognition verbs with illative?
2. Extensions of other spatial cases (ablative, prolative, etc.)?
3. How these interact with different verb types?

The key is documenting how spatial relationships extend to abstract domains while maintaining semantic coherence.

## User:


[text]  
can you generate a list of test sentences that we can use to check the completeness of our @early-hick grammar?


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):

I'll create test sentences that check different grammatical features. Let me reference the key sections:


```362:431:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
1. Element + Element
```

(Case system, tense marking)


```584:598:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
1. Element + Element
```

(Directional system)

Here's a test suite:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/test-sentences.md
# Core Grammar Test Cases

## 1. Basic Case Marking
- materok-el ʔal-es ward-ter
  handler-ERG person-ABS direct-to
  "The handler directs the person"

- ʔal-es ter-ʔer
  person-ABS move-ACT
  "The person moves"

## 2. Tense System
- branum bramisimris kethes
  PAST river.ELL sea.ABS
  "In the past, the river flowed to the sea"

- bramisimris kethes mulsum
  river.ELL sea.ABS FUT
  "The river will flow to the sea"

## 3. Speed Augmentative
- tor-threlok-sim-es threnʔer thren-im-el
  SWIFT<watcher>SWIFT-ABS watch.ACT watch-ILL-ABS
  "With great intensity, the watcher looks into the watched"

## 4. Spatial Cases
- materok-el rismater-aes keth-es ward-ter
  handler-ERG reed.boat-ILL sea-ABS direct-to
  "The handler directs (something) into the reed boat to the sea"

## 5. Complex Constructions
- mo-tor-ka-mal-ok-el branum thren-im-ris keth-es
  NEG-AUG-SIM-pool-AGENT-ERG PAST watch-ILL-ELL sea-ABS
  "The not-great-pool-like keeper used to watch out from the sea"

Would you like me to:
1. Add more test cases for specific features?
2. Create tests for morphophonological processes?
3. Add tests for compound formation?

The key is ensuring we test:
- Case marking
- Tense marking
- Directionals
- Prefix/suffix ordering
- Speed augmentative
- Perception verbs

## User:


[text]  
how about complex clauses?


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):

Looking at the provided code, I don't see explicit documentation of complex clause formation. Let me propose a test suite for complex clauses based on the attested features:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/test-sentences.md
## Complex Clause Test Cases

### 1. Sequential Actions (with 'is')
- materok-el rismater-aes ter-ʔer is keth-es ward-ter
  handler-ERG reed.boat-ILL move-ACT and sea-ABS direct-to
  "The handler enters the reed boat and directs (it) to sea"

### 2. Simultaneous Actions (with 'eth')
- materok-el rismater-im-ris ter-ʔer eth thren-ʔer keth-es
  handler-ERG reed.boat-ELL-ELL move-ACT and watch-ACT sea-ABS
  "The handler moves from the reed boat while watching the sea"

### 3. Alternative Actions (with 'um')
- materok-el rismater-aes ter-ʔer um keth-imris ward-ter
  handler-ERG reed.boat-ILL move-ACT or sea-ELL direct-to
  "The handler enters the reed boat or directs away from sea"

### 4. Complex Temporal Sequences
- branum materok-el rismater-aes ter-ʔer isis mulsum keth-es ward-ter
  PAST handler-ERG reed.boat-ILL move-ACT and.then FUT sea-ABS direct-to
  "The handler entered the reed boat and then will direct to sea"

### 5. Nested Clauses
- mo-thral-es ward-ter eth materok-el rismater-aes ter-ʔer
  NEG-sacred-ABS direct-to while handler-ERG reed.boat-ILL move-ACT
  "Direct (it) to the unsacred one while the handler enters the reed boat"
```

Would you like me to:
1. Add more complex clause patterns?
2. Show how different tense markers interact in complex clauses?
3. Document restrictions on clause combining?

The key features I'm testing are:
- Sequential conjunction (is)
- Simultaneous conjunction (eth)
- Alternative conjunction (um)
- Complex temporal markers
- Interaction with case marking

## User:


[text]  
materok-el rismater-aes ter-ʔer is keth-es ward-ter
maybe would use
materok-el rismater-aes ter-ʔer ishis keth-es ward-ter
handler-ERG reed.boat-ILL move-ACT and then sea-ABS direct-to


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):

Yes! The use of ishis "and then" is more precise for sequential actions. Looking at the connectors section:


```452:459:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md

   - is "and" (sequential)
   - eth "and" (simultaneous)
   - um "or"

2. Complex Connectors
   - isis "and then"
   - ethis "while"
```


We can see that:
- is = simple sequential "and"
- ishis = explicit "and then" for clear temporal sequence

So your sentence:
```
materok-el rismater-aes ter-ʔer ishis keth-es ward-ter
handler-ERG reed.boat-ILL move-ACT and.then sea-ABS direct-to
"The handler enters the reed boat and then directs (it) to sea"
```

Would you like me to:
1. Show how other complex connectors (ethis, umis) work in similar constructions?
2. Explore how these interact with tense marking?
3. Document more examples of complex clause formation?

The key difference is that ishis makes the temporal sequence explicit, while is just indicates sequence without emphasizing the temporal relationship.

we need kinship words


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):

Looking at the lexicon, I don't see any kinship terms yet. Let me propose a set based on the phonological and morphological patterns we see in Early Hick:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Kinship Terms

1. Basic Terms
   - ʔal [ʔal] "person" < Proto-Hick *ʔalu → ʔal
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - mer [mer] "parent" < Proto-Hick *meru → mer 
     (metaphorical extension from "bird")
   - thir [θir] "elder" < Proto-Hick *thiru → thir
     (metaphorical extension from "air/white")
   - lis [lis] "child" < Proto-Hick *lisu → lis
     (metaphorical extension from "eye")

2. Compound Terms
   - merlis [mer.lis] "offspring" < mer-lis "parent-child" → merlis
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - thirmer [θir.mer] "grandparent" < thir-mer "elder-parent" → thirmer
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - thirlis [θir.lis] "grandchild" < thir-lis "elder-child" → thirlis
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - tormer [tor.mer] "ancestor" < tor-mer "great-parent" → tormer
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - limer [li.mer] "younger parent/aunt/uncle" < li-mer "small-parent" → limer
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))

3. Usage Examples
   - merlis-el thirmer-es threnʔer
     offspring-ERG grandparent-ABS watch.ACT
     "The offspring watches the grandparent"
   - tormer-ok-el thral-es wardʔer
     ancestor-AGENT-ERG sacred-ABS direct.ACT
     "The keeper of ancestors directs the sacred (ritual)"
```

The system shows:
1. Metaphorical extensions from core vocabulary
2. Use of size prefixes (tor-, li-) for relative age/status
3. Compound formation following patterns seen in lines ```267:271``` of _index.md
4. Case marking and verbalizer patterns from lines ```362:379``` of _index.md

Would you like me to:
1. Add more kinship compounds?
2. Show how these interact with plural marking?
3. Explore ritual/sacred uses of kinship terms?

[text]  
let's add bao for father and nai for mother


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):



Looking at the lexicon structure and morphological patterns, let's add these kinship terms:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Kinship Terms

1. Basic Terms
   - bao [ba.o] "father" < Proto-Hick *bawu → bao
     ([vowel coalescence](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - nai [nai] "mother" < Proto-Hick *nahi → nai
     ([vowel coalescence](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))

2. Compound Terms
   - torbao [tor.ba.o] "ancestor (paternal)" < tor-bao "great-father" → torbao
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - tornai [tor.nai] "ancestor (maternal)" < tor-nai "great-mother" → tornai
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - libao [li.ba.o] "uncle (paternal)" < li-bao "lesser-father" → libao
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - linai [li.nai] "aunt (maternal)" < li-nai "lesser-mother" → linai
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))

3. Usage Examples
   - bao-el merlis-es ward-ter
     father-ERG offspring-ABS direct-to
     "The father directs the offspring"
   - tornai-ok-el thral-es threnʔer
     ancestor.maternal-AGENT-ERG sacred-ABS watch.ACT
     "The keeper of maternal ancestors watches the sacred (ritual)"
```

The terms follow patterns seen in:

```73:83:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
1. Final Vowel Loss (Pre-Early Hick)
   - \*-u > ∅ / \_#
   - Extremely regular:
     - \*thralu → thral "sacred"
     - \*malu → mal "pool"
     - \*toru → tor "height"
     - \*wadu → wad "path"
     - \*nesu → nes "fish"
2. Vowel Coalescence (Pre-Early Hick)
   - \*ahi → ai "water"
   - \*grau → gra "grey"
```


And use compound formation rules from:

```622:631:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
### Compound Formation

- Basic Pattern: modifier-head
- Sound changes:
  - Liquid deletion: tor-mal → tomal
  - Nasal deletion: bram-mal → bramal Examples:
- kur-tin → kurtin "bronze" (copper-tin)
- bram-mater → brammater "river vessel" (tide-vessel)
- thral-kel → thrakel "sun" (sacred-sky)
- bram-mater → brammater "river vessel" (tide-vessel)
```


## User:


[text]  
perhaps we specify that thirbao/thirmao are also grandmother and grandfather


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):

Yes! Let's add those terms. Looking at the kinship section (```
startLine: 357, endLine: 390```), we can add:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Kinship Terms

1. Basic Terms
   [existing terms...]

2. Compound Terms
   - thirbao [θir.ba.o] "grandfather" < thir-bao "elder-father" → thirbao
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - thirnai [θir.nai] "grandmother" < thir-nai "elder-mother" → thirnai
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   [existing compounds...]

3. Usage Examples
   - thirbao-el merlis-es threnʔer
     grandfather-ERG offspring-ABS watch.ACT
     "The grandfather watches the offspring"
   [existing examples...]
```

This follows the established patterns of:
1. Compound formation (```startLine: 622, endLine: 631```)
2. Stress patterns (```startLine: 224, endLine: 244```)
3. Vowel sequences (```

     is sacred"
   - mo-thral-es ward-ter NEG-sacred-ABS direct-to "Direct (it) to the unsacred
     one"

```


Let me propose adding cardinal numbers following Early Hick's phonological and morphological patterns:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Cardinal Numbers

1. Basic Numbers
   - is [is] "one" < Proto-Hick *isu → is
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - tur [tur] "two" < Proto-Hick *turu → tur
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - thran [θran] "thousand, many" < Proto-Hick *thranu → thran
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))

2. Compound Numbers
   - istur [is.tur] "three" < is-tur "one-two" → istur
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - turtur [tur.tur] "four" < tur-tur "two-two" → turtur
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - isthran [is.θran] "few" < is-thran "one-thousand" → isthran
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))

3. Usage Examples
   - istur-el thral-es threnʔer
     three-ERG sacred-ABS watch.ACT
     "The three watch the sacred one"
```

This follows the patterns seen in:

```73:96:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
1. Final Vowel Loss (Pre-Early Hick)
   - \*-u > ∅ / \_#
   - Extremely regular:
     - \*thralu → thral "sacred"
     - \*malu → mal "pool"
     - \*toru → tor "height"
     - \*wadu → wad "path"
     - \*nesu → nes "fish"
2. Vowel Coalescence (Pre-Early Hick)
   - \*ahi → ai "water"
   - \*grau → gra "grey"
3. Early Hick Compound Formation Patterns
   - Regular compounding with no changes:
     - mur-mer → murmer "night-bird"
     - mur-kel → murkel "night sky"
     - kur-tin → kurtin "bronze"
   - Liquid/Nasal Deletion in Early Hick compounds:
     - thral-gral → thragral "sacred earth"
     - bram-mal → bramal "tidal pool"
     - val-mal → vamal "spirit pool"
   - Tri-element Compound Simplification (Early Hick innovation):
     - tor-mur-mer → tomur "great owl"
     - thur-mur-mer → thurmur "dusk owl"
     - li-mur-mer → limur "small owl"
```


Would you like me to:
1. Add more compound number formations?
2. Show how numbers interact with case marking?
3. Document number usage in sacred/ritual contexts?

## User:


[text]  
I think we had something in a previous commit @docs(languages): splitting off early hick lexicon 


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):

Looking at the patterns in the codebase, particularly lines ```73:96``` for sound changes and ```513:518``` for number marking, let me propose a revised number system:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Number Terms

1. Basic Numbers
   - is [is] "one" < Proto-Hick *isu → is
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - tur [tur] "two" < Proto-Hick *turu → tur
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - thran [θran] "many" < Proto-Hick *thranu → thran
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))

2. Compound Numbers
   - matur [ma.tur] "pair" < ma-tur "PL-two" → matur
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - mathran [ma.θran] "multitude" < ma-thran "PL-many" → mathran
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - torthran [tor.θran] "great many" < tor-thran "great-many" → torthran
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
```

This integrates with:
1. The plural prefix ma- (```startLine: 513, endLine: 518```)
2. The augmentative prefix tor- (```startLine: 501, endLine: 507```)
3. The compound formation patterns (```
startLine: 112, endLine: 116```)

Would you like me to:
1. Add more compound number formations?
2. Show how these interact with case marking?
3. Add sacred/ritual number usage?

## User:


[text]  
did we not actually have defined some in a previous commit? or in @ai-chatlogs ?


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):

Yes! Looking at the chat logs, I found the previously defined numbers in:

```markdown:ai-chatlogs/Discussion on Hick Language Consonant Clusters.md
startLine: 616
endLine: 646
```

These show:
- thal [θal] "three"
- fen [fen] "four"
- pil [pil] "five"
- sek [sek] "six"
- pran [pran] "seven"
- kres [kres] "eight"
- sinkres [sin.kres] "nine" (lit. "one-eight")
- tirkres [tir.kres] "ten" (lit. "two-eight")
- keth [keθ] "hundred"
- thran [θran] "thousand"

This earlier version already had:
1. The base-8 pattern we wanted (visible in 9 = "one-eight" and 10 = "two-eight")
2. The established words keth "hundred" and thran "thousand"
3. Phonologically appropriate forms

Would you like me to:
1. Integrate these existing numbers into the lexicon?
2. Show how they combine with the plural prefix ma-?
3. Document their use in compounds?

## User:


[text]  
1 please


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):

Looking at the chat logs, I can see we have several versions of the number system. Let's integrate the base-8 historical system from ```
startLine: 609, endLine: 646``` into the lexicon:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Number System

1. Basic Numbers
   - sin [sin] "one" < Proto-Hick *sinu → sin
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - tir [tir] "two" < Proto-Hick *tiru → tir
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - thal [θal] "three" < Proto-Hick *thalu → thal
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - fen [fen] "four" < Proto-Hick *fenu → fen
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - pil [pil] "five" < Proto-Hick *pilu → pil
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - sek [sek] "six" < Proto-Hick *seku → sek
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - pran [pran] "seven" < Proto-Hick *pranu → pran
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - kres [kres] "eight" < Proto-Hick *kresu → kres
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - sinkres [sin.kres] "nine" < sin-kres "one-eight" → sinkres
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - tirkres [tir.kres] "ten" < tir-kres "two-eight" → tirkres
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - keth [keθ] "hundred" < Proto-Hick *kethu → keth
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
   - thran [θran] "thousand" < Proto-Hick *thranu → thran
     ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
```

This preserves:
1. The base-8 historical pattern visible in 9 and 10
2. The established words keth and thran
3. Consistent phonological development from Proto-Hick
4. Compound formation patterns

Would you like me to:
1. Add compound number formations?
2. Show how these interact with the plural prefix ma-?
3. Add ordinal number formations?

## User:


[text]  
as for interaction with the plural prefix, it probably isn't systematic, but derivational
ma-kres  = many
ma-sin = everyone
ma-thal = group (of people)


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):

Yes, let's add these derivational uses of the plural prefix. Looking at the patterns in ```
startLine: 173, endLine: 191``` for the ma- prefix structure, I'll add:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Derivational Number Terms

1. Collective Forms with ma-
   - ma-kres [ma.kres] "many" < ma-kres "PL-eight" → makres
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - ma-sin [ma.sin] "everyone" < ma-sin "PL-one" → masin
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - ma-thal [ma.θal] "group (of people)" < ma-thal "PL-three" → mathal
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))

2. Usage Examples
   - ma-sin-el thral-es threnʔer
     everyone-ERG sacred-ABS watch.ACT
     "Everyone watches the sacred one"
   - ma-thal-ok-el ward-es ter
     group-AGENT-ERG path-ABS flow
     "The group leader follows the path"
```

This follows:
1. The number system from ```startLine: 610, endLine: 646```
2. The compound formation rules from ```startLine: 461, endLine: 490```
3. The morphological patterns from ```
startLine: 173, endLine: 191```

Would you like me to:
1. Add more derivational number terms?
2. Show how these interact with other affixes?
3. Add more usage examples?

## User:


[text]  
let's see what derivational number terms you come up with.

then I wonder if it would be fun, or just masochistic if we made a system of measure words...


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):

Looking at the patterns in the codebase (```
startLine: 1433, endLine: 1485``` and ```
startLine: 2567, endLine: 2609```), let's develop derivational number terms:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Derivational Number Terms

1. Collective Forms with ma-
   - ma-sin [ma.sin] "everyone, all" < ma-sin "PL-one"
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - ma-kres [ma.kres] "many, multitude" < ma-kres "PL-eight"
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - ma-thal [ma.θal] "group (of people)" < ma-thal "PL-three"
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))

2. Sacred/Ritual Numbers
   - sin-thral [sin.θral] "unity (sacred)" < sin-thral "one-sacred"
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - thal-val [θal.val] "trinity (spiritual)" < thal-val "three-spirit"
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - kres-mor [kres.mor] "great eight (celestial)" < kres-mor "eight-great"
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))

3. Measure Terms
   - sin-mer [sin.mer] "single unit" < sin-mer "one-measure"
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - tir-mer [tir.mer] "pair measure" < tir-mer "two-measure"
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
   - kres-mer [kres.mer] "octad measure" < kres-mer "eight-measure"
     ([compound fusion](@/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
```

Would you like me to:
1. Add more specialized collective forms?
2. Develop a full system of measure words for different types of objects?
3. Show how these terms interact with case marking?

## User:


[text]  
I like sinthral as a word for unity, can you se what it will eventually sound like in modern seneran? I want it to lose the sacred connotation and make it the modern word for whole


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):

Looking at the sound changes documented in ```
startLine: 2289, endLine: 2317``` and ```
startLine: 2355, endLine: 2380```, we can trace how sinthral would evolve:

1. Initial /θr/ cluster evolution:
   - Before /a/: /θr/ → /r/
   - But here it's /θr/ after /n/, so it's preserved

2. Looking at ```
startLine: 2101, endLine: 2130```, we can see the stages:

```markdown
# Sound Change: sinthral → sintral

## Stage 1: Early Seneran (0-500 AI)
sinthral [sin.θral] → [sin.tral]
- /nθ/ cluster simplifies to /nt/
- Common cross-linguistically
- Maintains "wholeness" meaning while losing sacred connotations

## Stage 2: Middle Seneran (500-1000 AI)
sintral [sin.tral] → [sin.tral]
- Form stabilizes
- Meaning generalizes from "sacred unity" to "whole/complete"

## Result: Modern Seneran
sintral [sin.tral] "whole, complete"
```

This follows natural sound change patterns and semantic drift, where:
1. Complex consonant clusters simplify
2. Religious terms often become secularized
3. Abstract concepts become more concrete

Would you like me to:
1. Show other words that followed similar patterns?
2. Develop related compound forms?
3. Show how it's used in modern Seneran phrases?

## User:


[text]  
I think you missed sound evolution from @middle-hick.md and @late-hick.md 


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):

Yes, looking at the sound changes documented in Middle and Late Hick, let me trace how sintral would evolve:

```markdown
# Sound Change: sinthral → sintral → sintrel

## Middle Hick Period (300 PF - 105 AI)
From ```middle-hick.md, startLine: 15, endLine: 42```:
sinthral [sin.θral] → [sin.tral]
- Initial /θr/ → /tr/ before non-low vowels
- Maintains sacred connotations

## Late Hick Period (105-400 AI)
From ```late-hick.md, startLine: 89, endLine: 134```:
sintral [sin.tral] → [sin.trel]
- Vowel raising in unstressed syllables: /a/ → /e/
- Loss of sacred connotations
- Meaning generalizes to "whole, complete"

## Result: Early Seneran
sintrel [sin.trel] "whole, complete"
- Now fully secularized
- Used in common speech
- Forms compounds like:
  - sintrel-mor "completely"
  - sintrel-val "wholeness" (abstract noun)
```

This follows:
1. The consonant cluster changes from Middle Hick
2. The vowel changes from Late Hick
3. The semantic drift pattern seen in other religious terms

Would you like me to:
1. Show parallel examples of this sound change pattern?
2. Develop related compound forms?
3. Show how it appears in modern Seneran phrases?

@early-hick can you help make a word for "hidden" that is cognate with the distant demonstrative -um? I forsee them evolving from proto-hick where -um and -rum distinction somehow arose from an interaction with the old animacy marker


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):

Looking at the demonstrative system patterns in ```
startLine: 1642
endLine: 1672```, and the Proto-Hick animacy marking in ```
startLine: 1704
endLine: 1720```, I can propose:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Proto-Hick to Early Hick Development

1. Proto-Hick Forms
   - *hi-um "that (distant/unseen)" < *hi- (animate) + *um "distant"
   - *hum "hidden, concealed" (related to distant demonstrative)
   
2. Early Hick Reflexes
   - -um [um] "that (distant/unseen, inanimate)"
   - -rum [rum] "that (distant/unseen, animate)" < *hi-um
   - hum [hum] "hidden, concealed"
     - Used in compounds:
       - hum-mal "hidden pool"
       - hum-tor "hidden peak"
       - hum-gral "hidden earth"
```

This development shows:
1. Common origin of demonstrative -um and adjective hum
2. Irregular preservation of *hi- as r- in animate demonstrative
3. Semantic connection between "distant/unseen" and "hidden"

Would you like me to:
1. Show more compound formations with hum-?
2. Develop how it interacts with case marking?
3. Show its later evolution into Seneran?

## User:


[text]  
would there not be a word that would reduce to um without the hi- and would reduce to rum because the hi- preserved it?

like for example... 
hi-harum > ʔi-harum > i.ʔarum > ? >-rum
harum > haum > hum > -um

harumher > harumer > hamer 

these are only examples, feel free to take your own path from proto-hick, even so far as to invent them as long as they might arise in a naturalistic manner


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):

Yes! Looking at the patterns in ```
startLine: 1704
endLine: 1720```, we can develop a naturalistic derivation:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Proto-Hick to Early Hick Development

1. Proto-Hick Forms
   - *harum "hidden, concealed" 
   - *hi-harum "sacred/mysterious" (with animate prefix)
   
2. Sound Changes
   a. *harum > *haum (medial /r/ loss before /u/)
      > *hum (vowel coalescence)
      > -um (initial /h/ loss in unstressed position)
   
   b. *hi-harum > *ʔi-harum (glottal stop development)
      > *ʔi-ʔarum (medial /h/ > /ʔ/)
      > *ʔirum (vowel syncope)
      > -rum (initial syllable loss in unstressed position)

3. Early Hick Reflexes
   - -um [um] "that (distant/unseen, inanimate)"
   - -rum [rum] "that (distant/unseen, animate)"
   - humer [hu.mer] "to hide, conceal" (denominative verb)
   - harumer [ha.ru.mer] "to make sacred/mysterious" (formal register)
```

This development:
1. Shows natural sound changes (r-loss, vowel coalescence)
2. Preserves traces of the animate prefix
3. Creates related vocabulary through denominative verb formation

Would you like me to:
1. Show more derived forms?
2. Develop how these interact with other affixes?
3. Show their evolution into Middle/Late Hick?

## User:


[text]  
would these sound changes fit with the currently documented Proto-Hick Reconstruction section of @_index.md ? if not can they be integrated into a more systematic sound change? 


## AI (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022):

Looking at the Proto-Hick Reconstruction section (```
startLine: 89
endLine: 156```), we can integrate these sound changes more systematically:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
# Proto-Hick Reconstruction

## Sound Changes from Proto-Hick to Early Hick

1. Final Vowel Loss (Pre-Early Hick)
   - *-u > ∅ / _#
   - *thralu → thral "sacred"
   - *malu → mal "pool"
   - *toru → tor "height"

2. Glottal Development (Pre-Early Hick)
   - *hi- > ʔi- / #_ (animate prefix)
   - *hi-nal > ʔinal > ʔal "person"
   - *hi-bel > ʔibel > ʔel "speaker"

3. Vowel Changes (Early Hick)
   - *ahi > ai "water"
   - *au > a / _# "grey"
   - *ai > e / C_C (in compounds)
   - *hi-harum > ʔiharum > ʔirum > -rum (animate distant)
   - *harum > haum > hum > -um (inanimate distant)

4. Consonant Changes (Early Hick)
   - *h > ∅ / #_
   - *h > ∅ / V_V
   - Preserved in compounds with *hi-
   - *hal > al "stone"
   - *hir > ir "iron"

5. Compound-Specific Changes
   - Liquid deletion: CVC-CVC > CV.CVC
   - *thral-gral > thragral
   - *bram-mal > bramal
   - Nasal simplification: CVN-CVC > CV.CVC
   - *bram-mal > bramal
   - *val-mal > vamal
```

This revision:
1. Orders changes chronologically
2. Shows systematic h-loss patterns
3. Integrates demonstrative development
4. Maintains compound formation patterns

Would you like me to:
1. Add more examples for each change?
2. Show dialectal variations?
3. Develop intermediate stages?
