actually never mind. I don't really like that leaf and sky have the same word. I just noticed


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

I notice this is a continuation of a previous conversation, but I don't have the context about which words you're referring to. Could you please share:

1. The specific words that are the same
2. The context or code where these words appear
3. What you'd like to change them to

This will help me provide more specific and helpful suggestions for your situation.
