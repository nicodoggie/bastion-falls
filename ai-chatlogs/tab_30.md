in @proto-hick.md currently, by default when final vowel is somehow lost, it's repaired by adding -u. what if, if it isn't lexically defined, the strategy is to depend on vowel harmony. considering our current vowel inventory, how will that work naturalistically?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Let's think about this from a naturalistic phonological perspective. In Proto-Hick's current 
vowel inventory, we have:

```
i   u
e   o
    a
```

For vowel harmony repair strategies, the most natural approach would be to echo the last 
remaining vowel in the word, with some constraints:

1. If the last vowel is /i/, repair with /i/
2. If the last vowel is /u/, repair with /u/ 
3. If the last vowel is /e/, repair with /i/
4. If the last vowel is /o/, repair with /u/
5. If the last vowel is /a/, repair with /u/

The reasoning:
- High vowels (/i/, /u/) naturally persist and copy themselves
- Mid vowels (/e/, /o/) raise to their closest high vowel counterpart
- Low vowel /a/ defaults to /u/ as it's the most common repair vowel cross-linguistically
  for this position

This creates a more naturalistic system than a blanket /-u/ repair, as it:
1. Respects vowel harmony patterns common in natural languages
2. Creates predictable phonological patterns based on height/backness
3. Still maintains /u/ as a common repair vowel where harmony isn't clear

Would you like me to suggest how to implement this in the grammar rules or provide 
examples of how words would be affected?

### Phonological Processes

1. Obligatory Onset:

   - Ø → ʔ / #\_V
   - Examples:
     - *ahi → *ʔahi "water"
     - *imru → *ʔimru "group, party"

2. Final Vowels:
   - Preserved in all positions
   - Most commonly _-u, _-a
   - Rare \*-i in some forms


```
[text]  
I think this is good. perhaps we can update this in the @### Phonological Processes section


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Here's how we could update the Phonological Processes section to include the vowel 
harmony repair strategy:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/proto-hick.md
### Phonological Processes

1. Obligatory Onset:
   - Ø → ʔ / #_V
   - Examples:
     - *ahi → *ʔahi "water"
     - *imru → *ʔimru "group, party"

2. Final Vowels:
   - Preserved in all positions
   - Repair strategy follows vowel harmony with the last vowel:
     - After /i/: repair with -i
     - After /u/: repair with -u
     - After /e/: repair with -i
     - After /o/: repair with -u
     - After /a/: repair with -u
   - Examples:
     - *kati(C) → *kati
     - *penu(C) → *peni
     - *mako(C) → *maku
     - *tapa(C) → *tapu
```

This update:
- Maintains the existing onset rule
- Replaces the vague "most commonly _-u, _-a" with specific harmony rules
- Adds clear examples showing how the repair works
- Uses (C) to show where a consonant was lost requiring repair

Would you like me to add more examples or expand on any part of this?

## User:


[text]  
would vowel harmony not work with low central /a/? is there a naturalistic reason to leave it out?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Actually, you raise a good point! I was too quick to default /a/ to /u/. In many natural 
languages with vowel harmony, /a/ does participate in harmony systems, typically 
patterning with back vowels.

We could revise the system to:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/proto-hick.md
### Phonological Processes

1. Obligatory Onset:
   - Ø → ʔ / #_V
   - Examples:
     - *ahi → *ʔahi "water"
     - *imru → *ʔimru "group, party"

2. Final Vowels:
   - Preserved in all positions
   - Repair strategy follows vowel harmony with the last vowel:
     - After front vowels /i, e/: repair with -i
     - After back vowels /u, o, a/: repair with -u
   - Examples:
     - *kati(C) → *kati
     - *penu(C) → *peni
     - *mako(C) → *maku
     - *tapa(C) → *tapu
```

This is more naturalistic because:
1. It creates a simpler front/back harmony system
2. Treats /a/ as a back vowel, which is common cross-linguistically
3. Matches patterns seen in languages like Turkish, where /a/ patterns with back vowels
   in harmony

The previous version unnecessarily complicated things by splitting each vowel into its 
own rule, when natural languages tend to group vowels by features like frontness/backness.

[text]  
heh, you know? chatgpt told me the same thing


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Ha! That's actually a good validation point - when multiple AI models converge on the 
same linguistic analysis, it's often because we're drawing from similar patterns in 
natural languages.

The front/back harmony system is particularly well-attested in:
- Turkic languages (Turkish, Uyghur)
- Mongolic languages
- Some Tungusic languages
- Hungarian
- Finnish

It's one of those linguistic features that's so common and stable that it makes sense 
both models would identify it as the more naturalistic option. The main difference is 
that these natural languages often have more complex vowel inventories, but the basic 
principle of front/back harmony remains solid even with our simpler 5-vowel system.

Would you like to explore how this harmony system might interact with other aspects of 
Proto-Hick's phonology?

## User:


[text]  
sure, then we can consider what its implications are on @early-hick 


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at Early Hick's development, this vowel harmony repair strategy would have 
implications for several areas:

1. In the lexicon (referencing):

```33:43:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
- haran [ha.ran] "split, divide" < Proto-Hick \*haranu → haran
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  See: [Number System](#number-system),
  [Compound Formation](#compound-formation)
- ward [ward] "direct, guide" < Proto-Hick \*wardu → ward
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  See: [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual) Note: Used for both physical guidance and
  metaphorical direction/instruction
- tak [tak] "strike, impact" < Proto-Hick \*taku → tak
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Onomatopoeic origin
```

Words like "haran" and "ward" would have been repaired differently based on their last vowel:
- *haranu → haran (front vowel /a/ → /u/)
- *wardu → ward (back vowel /a/ → /u/)

2. In compound formation (referencing):

```823:829:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
- Element + Element: kurtin "bronze" < kur-tin "copper-tin" → kurtin
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
- Descriptor + Element: grakur "grey copper" < gra-kur "grey-copper" → grakur
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
- Location + Base: brammater "river-vessel" < bram-mater "tide-vessel" →
  brammater
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
```

The harmony would affect how compounds were formed when final vowels were lost:
- kurtin < *kur(u)-tin(i) → kurtin (back vowel /u/ → /u/)
- grakur < *gra(u)-kur(u) → grakur (back vowel /a/ → /u/)

3. Most significantly in morphological processes (referencing):

```378:410:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md

## Nominal Morphology

### Agentive Marking

1. Primary Marker
   - -ok [ok]: agentive nominalizer (forms agent nouns, both occupational and
     active) Examples:
   - materok "boatman" < mater-ok "vessel-AGENT" (one who works with vessels)
   - wardok "guide" < ward-ok "direct-AGENT" (one who directs)
   - threnok "watcher" < thren-ok "watch-AGENT" (one who watches)

### Size and Intensity Markers

1. Diminutive (li-)

   - Prefix meaning "small, lesser"
   - Examples:
     - limal [li.mal] "small pool, pond"
     - liren [li.ren] "small deer, fawn"
     - lines [li.nes] "small fish, minnow"

2. Augmentative (tor-)
   - Prefix meaning "great, mighty" (from "height, peak")
   - Examples:
     - tornes [tor.nes] "great fish, whale"
     - topel [to.pel] "great bear" (tor-pel → topel, liquid deletion)
     - tomal [to.mal] "great pool, lake" (tor-mal → tomal, liquid deletion)
3. Speed Augmentative (tor- -sim)
   - Circumfix combining the argumentative tor- with the translative -sim to
     mean a swift change in speed

### Number Marking
```

The agentive and size markers would show harmony:
- -ok [ok] (agentive): Always /u/ because of back /o/
- li- (diminutive): Would take /i/ in repairs because of front /i/
- tor- (augmentative): Would take /u/ in repairs because of back /o/

Would you like me to propose specific updates to any of these sections to reflect 
the vowel harmony system?

## User:


[text]  
would there be a reason why vowel harmony might at least partially disappear by early hick? or even at least not as strong of a rule


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at Early Hick's development, there are several naturalistic reasons why 
Proto-Hick's vowel harmony might weaken or partially disappear:

1. Compound Formation (referencing):

```823:829:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
- Element + Element: kurtin "bronze" < kur-tin "copper-tin" → kurtin
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
- Descriptor + Element: grakur "grey copper" < gra-kur "grey-copper" → grakur
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
- Location + Base: brammater "river-vessel" < bram-mater "tide-vessel" →
  brammater
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
```

The extensive compound system would create many situations where vowels from 
different harmony classes come together. Over time, this could weaken the harmony 
system.

2. Sound Changes (referencing):

```51:54:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
- Initial sound changes:
  - Unstressed vowel reduction begins
  - Compound simplification starts
  - Some liquid deletion word-internally
```

Early Hick shows unstressed vowel reduction, compound simplification, and liquid 
deletion. These processes would create new vowel sequences that might not follow 
harmony rules.

3. Contact Effects:

```41:45:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
- More consistent contact with pre-Kalassarian traders
- Maritime trade vocabulary expansion
- Astronomical terminology development
- Sacred site naming conventions formalize
- Initial written forms appear (borrowed script)
```

Contact with pre-Kalassarian traders and borrowed vocabulary could introduce 
non-harmonic patterns.

This kind of harmony loss is attested in natural languages:
- Persian lost much of its Old Iranian vowel harmony through similar processes
- Some Turkic languages (like Uzbek) have weakened harmony systems due to contact
- Many Mongolic languages show varying degrees of harmony breakdown in compounds

So while Proto-Hick might have had a strong front/back harmony system, it's very 
natural for Early Hick to show a weakened version, especially in:
- Compounds
- Borrowed terms
- Grammatical affixes
- Unstressed syllables

Would you like me to propose specific examples of how this harmony breakdown might 
manifest in Early Hick?

## User:


[text]  
would the shift from penultimate stress to primary stress shift to word initial position, with possible secondary stress on multisyllabic compounds also have a role?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes! The stress shift would be a significant factor in weakening vowel harmony. Looking 
at the evidence in Early Hick:


```156:181:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
### Weight Distribution Constraints

1. Stress Patterns

   - Primary stress falls on first syllable of simple words
   - In compounds:
     - a. First element maintains primary stress
     - b. Second element reduces unless sacred/ritual term
     - c. Three-element compounds:
       - Primary stress on first element
       - Secondary stress on final element
       - Middle element reduces
   - Exceptions:
     - Sacred/ritual terms resist reduction
     - Maritime terms maintain second element weight
     - Recent compounds may preserve full weight
     - Morphological boundaries may preserve weight

   Examples:

   - tor-mal → [ˈto.məl] "great pool"
   - thral-kel → [ˈθral.kel] "sacred sky" (no reduction - sacred term)
   - tor-ma-ter → [ˈtor.mə.ˌter] "great-pool-flow"
   - bram-ma-ter → [ˈbram.ma.ˌter] "tide-vessel" (no reduction - maritime)

## Prosodic System
```


The stress patterns show:
1. Primary stress on first syllable
2. Secondary stress in compounds
3. Unstressed syllables undergo reduction

This shift would naturally weaken vowel harmony because:

1. The new initial stress pattern creates a strong-weak alternation that can 
   override harmony requirements:
   - /'tor.məl/ "great pool" (reduction of /a/ to [ə])
   - /'bram.mə.ˌter/ "river vessel"

2. In compounds, we see evidence of this in the lexicon:


```823:829:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
- Element + Element: kurtin "bronze" < kur-tin "copper-tin" → kurtin
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
- Descriptor + Element: grakur "grey copper" < gra-kur "grey-copper" → grakur
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
- Location + Base: brammater "river-vessel" < bram-mater "tide-vessel" →
  brammater
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
```


The compounds show stress-based vowel reduction rather than harmony:
- 'kurtin (not \*'kurtu)
- 'grakur (not \*'graku)
- 'brammater (not \*'brammatu)

3. The development of schwa [ə] in unstressed positions further disrupts the 
   harmony system:


```238:252:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
2. After voiceless stops in unstressed syllables:

   - /karan/ → [kərən] "stream"
   - /tamal/ → [təmal] "pool-like"

3. In grammatical prefixes:

   - /ka-/ → [kə-] (similarity prefix)
   - /ma-/ → [mə-] (plural prefix) See:
     [Morphological Prefixes](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/morphology.md#prefixes)

4. Between identical consonants:
   - /malam/ → [məlam] "pooled"
   - /ranar/ → [rənər] "flowing"

```


This is a very natural development path:
1. Proto-Hick: Vowel harmony system with penultimate stress
2. Early Hick: Stress shifts to initial position
3. Result: Harmony weakens as stress-based reduction becomes dominant
4. Final stage: Harmony remains only vestigially in certain morphological contexts

This pattern is similar to how stress shifts affected vowel harmony in some 
Uralic languages, where initial stress led to reduction and neutralization in 
non-initial syllables.

[text]  
let's start with applying the suitable changes to Early Hick Lexicon @lexicon.md and the Ontolex-Lemon formatted version @lexicon.jsonld 


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Looking at the lexicon data, we need to update the etymologies to reflect the 
front/back vowel harmony system's breakdown. Here's how we can modify the entries:

For lexicon.md, we should add a note about vowel harmony in the historical development:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
## Historical Sound Changes

### Proto-Hick Vowel Harmony Loss

Proto-Hick's front/back vowel harmony system weakened in Early Hick due to:
- Initial stress shift (Proto-Hick penultimate → Early Hick initial)
- Compound formation creating disharmonic sequences
- Unstressed vowel reduction to [ə]
- Contact-induced changes

Examples of harmony breakdown:
- *haranu → haran (not \*haranu despite back /a/)
- *wardu → ward (expected form maintained)
- *taku → tak (expected form maintained)
- Compounds: kurtin < *kur(u)-tin(i) (disharmonic sequence preserved)
```

For lexicon.jsonld, we need to update the etymology fields. Here's an example pattern:

```jsonld:data/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.jsonld
{
  "@id": "eh:haran",
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
  "canonicalForm": {
    "@type": "ontolex:Form",
    "writtenRep": "haran",
    "phoneticRep": "ha.ran"
  },
  "etymology": {
    "@type": "etymon:Etymology",
    "etymon:protoform": "Proto-Hick *haranu",
    "etymon:soundChange": [
      "final vowel loss",
      "vowel harmony loss (expected *haranu)"
    ],
    "etymon:note": "Shows early breakdown of Proto-Hick back vowel harmony"
  }
}
```

Would you like me to provide more specific examples of entries to update in either 
file?

## User:


[text]  
perhaps this note should be instead just a link to the proto-hick article?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, you're right. Instead of duplicating the information about vowel harmony 
loss, we should reference the Proto-Hick article. For lexicon.md, we can modify the 
etymological notes to be more concise:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
## Historical Sound Changes

For Proto-Hick vowel harmony and its development into Early Hick, see: 
[Proto-Hick Phonological Processes](@/languages/hick/proto-hick.md#phonological-processes)
```

This keeps the documentation DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and ensures consistency by 
having a single source of truth for the vowel harmony system's development.

The relevant sections we need to modify in lexicon.md are:


```31:43:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
#### Basic Terms

- haran [ha.ran] "split, divide" < Proto-Hick \*haranu → haran
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  See: [Number System](#number-system),
  [Compound Formation](#compound-formation)
- ward [ward] "direct, guide" < Proto-Hick \*wardu → ward
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  See: [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual) Note: Used for both physical guidance and
  metaphorical direction/instruction
- tak [tak] "strike, impact" < Proto-Hick \*taku → tak
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Onomatopoeic origin
```


These basic terms show the results of vowel harmony loss without needing to explain 
the process itself.

Would you like me to show how to update specific etymological entries to reference 
this change?

## User:

## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



I'll help update the lexicon while preserving all data. Let's start with the

For stress-related vowel changes, see:
[Vowel Allophony](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#vowel-allophony)
```

For the lexical entries, we should update etymologies to reference both sound

Let's update more entries, focusing on key semantic fields. I'll reference the 
relevant sections from the input files.

For lexicon.md, let's update the Sacred & Ritual terms first, since they show 
important stress and reduction patterns:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Sacred & Ritual

#### Basic Terms

- thral [θral] "sacred, ritual; day" < Proto-Hick *thralu → thral
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#historical-development))
  Note: Resists vowel reduction in compounds
  See: [Time Terms](#time--celestial)

- thren [θren] "watch, observe (ritual)" < Proto-Hick *threnu → thren
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#historical-development))
  Note: Maintains [e] in unstressed positions

- thimer [θi.mer] "spiritual nurturing" < Proto-Hick *ha-meru → thimer
  ([vowel reduction, stress shift](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#vowel-allophony))
  See: [Bird Terms](#bird-terms-nocturnal)
```

For the JSON-LD, let's update these entries with detailed sound change references:

```jsonld:data/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.jsonld
{
  "@id": "eh:thral",
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
  "canonicalForm": {
    "@type": "ontolex:Form",
    "writtenRep": "thral",
    "phoneticRep": "θral"
  },
  "etymology": {
    "@type": "etymon:Etymology",
    "etymon:protoform": "Proto-Hick *thralu",
    "etymon:soundChange": [
      "final vowel loss",
      "stress shift to initial syllable",
      "resistance to reduction (sacred term)"
    ],
    "etymon:reference": [
      "@/languages/hick/proto-hick.md#phonological-processes",
      "@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#exceptions"
    ]
  }
}
```

These updates reflect the patterns shown in:


```156:181:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
### Weight Distribution Constraints

1. Stress Patterns

   - Primary stress falls on first syllable of simple words
   - In compounds:
     - a. First element maintains primary stress
     - b. Second element reduces unless sacred/ritual term
     - c. Three-element compounds:
       - Primary stress on first element
       - Secondary stress on final element
       - Middle element reduces
   - Exceptions:
     - Sacred/ritual terms resist reduction
     - Maritime terms maintain second element weight
     - Recent compounds may preserve full weight
     - Morphological boundaries may preserve weight

   Examples:

   - tor-mal → [ˈto.məl] "great pool"
   - thral-kel → [ˈθral.kel] "sacred sky" (no reduction - sacred term)
   - tor-ma-ter → [ˈtor.mə.ˌter] "great-pool-flow"
   - bram-ma-ter → [ˈbram.ma.ˌter] "tide-vessel" (no reduction - maritime)

## Prosodic System
```


And the exceptions for sacred terms shown in:


```238:252:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
2. After voiceless stops in unstressed syllables:

   - /karan/ → [kərən] "stream"
   - /tamal/ → [təmal] "pool-like"

3. In grammatical prefixes:

   - /ka-/ → [kə-] (similarity prefix)
   - /ma-/ → [mə-] (plural prefix) See:
     [Morphological Prefixes](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/morphology.md#prefixes)

4. Between identical consonants:
   - /malam/ → [məlam] "pooled"
   - /ranar/ → [rənər] "flowing"

```

## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Let's continue updating the lexicon entries, focusing on the Animals section 
since it shows interesting patterns of compound formation and stress effects:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Animals

- nes [nes] "fish" < Proto-Hick *nesu → nes
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#historical-development))
  See: [Maritime Terms](#maritime-terms)

- mer [mer] "bird" < Proto-Hick *meru → mer
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#historical-development))
  Note: Cultural connection between birds and parenting roles
  See: [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual), [Kinship Terms](#kinship-terms)

- pel [pel] "bear" < Proto-Hick *pelu → pel
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#historical-development))
  Note: Maintains [e] in compounds

#### Compound Animal Terms

- tornes ['tor.nes] "whale" < tor-nes "great-fish" → tornes
  ([compound fusion, stress shift](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#stress-dependent-reduction))

- venmer ['ven.mer] "wing bird" < ven-mer "wing-bird" → venmer
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
  Note: Resists reduction due to sacred associations

- tomur ['to.mur] "great owl" < tor-mur-mer → tomur
  ([compound simplification](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-simplification))
  Note: Shows liquid deletion and vowel reduction
```

For the JSON-LD version:

```jsonld:data/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.jsonld
{
  "@id": "eh:tornes",
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry",

      "@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#exceptions"
    ]
  }
}
```

These updates reflect the patterns shown in:


```255:267:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
1. In Compounds:

   - First element maintains stress: 'tor-mal → ['tor.məl]
   - Second element reduced: mal-'ter → [məl.'ter]

2. With Prefixes:

   - Stressed prefix blocks reduction: 'ma-tor → ['ma.tor]
   - Unstressed prefix shows reduction: ka-'tor → [kə.'tor]

3. In Three-syllable Words:
   - Primary stress blocks reduction: 'ka-ra-nal → ['ka.rə.nəl]
   - Secondary stress partially blocks: ˌka-'ra-nal → [ˌka.'ra.nəl]
```


And the exceptions for sacred/maritime terms shown in:


```271:275:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
- Maintains [a] in:
  - Stressed syllables
  - Sacred/formal terms
  - Recent compounds See:

## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Let's continue with the morphological affixes section, since it shows important 
patterns of stress and reduction:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Morphological Affixes

#### Augmentative/Diminutive

- tor- [tor] "great" < Proto-Hick *toru → tor
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#historical-development))
  Examples:
  - tornes [ˈtor.nes] "whale" < tor-nes "great-fish"
  - tomal [ˈto.məl] "lake" < tor-mal "great-pool"
  Note: Shows liquid deletion and vowel reduction in unstressed syllables

- li- [li] "small" < Proto-Hick *lisu → li
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#historical-development))
  Examples:
  - limal [ˈli.məl] "pond" < li-mal "small-pool"
  - limur [ˈli.mur] "small owl" < li-mur "small-owl"
  Note: Triggers reduction in following syllables

#### Agentive Suffix

- -ok [-ok] "agent" < Proto-Hick *-oku → -ok
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#historical-development))
  Examples:
  - materok [ˈma.te.ˌrok] "boatman" < mater-ok "vessel-AGENT"
  - wardok [ˈwar.dok] "guide" < ward-ok "direct-AGENT"
  Note: Receives secondary stress in three-syllable words
```

These updates reflect the stress and reduction patterns shown in:


```255:267:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
1. In Compounds:

   - First element maintains stress: 'tor-mal → ['tor.məl]
   - Second element reduced: mal-'ter → [məl.'ter]

   - Secondary stress partially blocks: ˌka-'ra-nal → [ˌka.'ra.nəl]
```


And the exceptions for sacred/maritime terms shown in:


```271:275:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
- Maintains [a] in:
  - Stressed syllables

Would you like me to continue with another section?

## User:


[text]  
is it naturalistic to have all final vowels to disappear? probably some intermediate devoicing in between protohick and early hick?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

You raise a good point. Looking at the historical development section:


```32:55:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
## Early Hick (prehistory to ~300 PF)

- Purely oral tradition
- Core maritime and nature vocabulary established
- Complex compound system develops
- Sacred/ritual terminology crystallizes

## Middle Hick (300 PF to 105 AI)

- More consistent contact with pre-Kalassarian traders
- Maritime trade vocabulary expansion
- Astronomical terminology development
- Sacred site naming conventions formalize
- Initial written forms appear (borrowed script)

## Late Hick/Early Seneran (105 AI to 400 AI)

- Kalassarian settlement period begins
- Administrative terminology adoption
- Initial sound changes:
  - Unstressed vowel reduction begins
  - Compound simplification starts
  - Some liquid deletion word-internally

```


The transition from Proto-Hick to Early Hick would be more naturalistic with 
intermediate stages of final vowel weakening. We should modify the historical 
development to show:

1. Proto-Hick stage: Full final vowels
   - *thralu [ˈθra.lu]
   - *wardu [ˈwar.du]
   - *toru [ˈto.ru]

2. Early Pre-Hick: Final vowel devoicing
   - *thralu > [ˈθra.lu̥]
   - *wardu > [ˈwar.du̥]
   - *toru > [ˈto.ru̥]

3. Late Pre-Hick: Final vowel reduction
   - [ˈθra.lu̥] > [ˈθra.lə]
   - [ˈwar.du̥] > [ˈwar.də]
   - [ˈto.ru̥] > [ˈto.rə]

4. Early Hick: Final vowel loss
   - [ˈθra.lə] > [ˈθral]
   - [ˈwar.də] > [ˈward]
   - [ˈto.rə] > [ˈtor]

This would better explain why certain compounds preserve traces of the original 
vowels, as seen in:


```834:841:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
- Element + Element: kurtin "bronze" < kur-tin "copper-tin" → kurtin
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
- Descriptor + Element: grakur "grey copper" < gra-kur "grey-copper" → grakur
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
- Location + Base: brammater "river-vessel" < bram-mater "tide-vessel" →
  brammater
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
```


Would you like me to show how to update the lexicon entries to reflect this more 
naturalistic development?

## User:


[text]  
I don't really see the relevance ot those 3 compounds. I don't really see any kind of final vowel preservation


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

You're right - I apologize for misinterpreting the compound evidence. 
Looking at the historical development section:


```32:54:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
## Early Hick (prehistory to ~300 PF)

- Purely oral tradition
- Core maritime and nature vocabulary established
- Complex compound system develops
- Sacred/ritual terminology crystallizes

## Middle Hick (300 PF to 105 AI)

- More consistent contact with pre-Kalassarian traders
- Maritime trade vocabulary expansion
- Astronomical terminology development
- Sacred site naming conventions formalize
- Initial written forms appear (borrowed script)

## Late Hick/Early Seneran (105 AI to 400 AI)

- Kalassarian settlement period begins
- Administrative terminology adoption
- Initial sound changes:
  - Unstressed vowel reduction begins
  - Compound simplification starts
  - Some liquid deletion word-internally
```


We should add an intermediate stage between Proto-Hick and Early Hick showing the 
gradual process of final vowel weakening. Here's a proposed update:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
## Historical Development

### Pre-Hick Stage 1 (~1000-800 PF)
- Final vowels begin devoicing in unstressed syllables
- *thralu > [ˈθra.lu̥]
- *wardu > [ˈwar.du̥]
- *taku > [ˈta.ku̥]

### Pre-Hick Stage 2 (~800-600 PF)
- Devoiced vowels reduce to schwa
- [ˈθra.lu̥] > [ˈθra.lə]
- [ˈwar.du̥] > [ˈwar.də]
- [ˈta.ku̥] > [ˈta.kə]

### Early Hick (~600 PF onward)
- Final schwa deletion
- [ˈθra.lə] > [ˈθral]
- [ˈwar.də] > [ˈward]
- [ˈta.kə] > [ˈtak]

- Core maritime and nature vocabulary established
- Complex compound system develops
- Sacred/ritual terminology crystallizes
```

This more gradual development is typologically common and better explains the 
complete loss of final vowels. Would you like me to show how to update the lexicon 
entries to reflect these intermediate stages?

## User:


[text]  
I suppose even final a e and o, have other avenues? or do all of them go to schwa? I have a theory that maybe stress change or language contact with some unknown language may have been a trigger for all final vowel loss. what is a naturalistic pathway though?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the historical development, we can make this more naturalistic. 
Currently we have:


```32:56:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
## Pre-Hick Stage 1 (~1000-800 PF)

- Final vowels begin devoicing in unstressed syllables
- \*thralu > [ˈθra.lu̥]
- \*wardu > [ˈwar.du̥]
- \*taku > [ˈta.ku̥]

## Pre-Hick Stage 2 (~800-600 PF)

- Devoiced vowels reduce to schwa
- [ˈθra.lu̥] > [ˈθra.lə]
- [ˈwar.du̥] > [ˈwar.də]
- [ˈta.ku̥] > [ˈta.kə]
- Initial written forms appear (borrowed script)
## Early Hick (~600 PF onward)
## Late Hick/Early Seneran (105 AI to 400 AI)
- Final schwa deletion
- [ˈθra.lə] > [ˈθral]
- [ˈwar.də] > [ˈward]
- [ˈta.kə] > [ˈtak]
  - Unstressed vowel reduction begins
- Purely oral tradition
- Core maritime and nature vocabulary established
- Complex compound system develops
- Sacred/ritual terminology crystallizes
```


The uniform treatment of all final vowels isn't very naturalistic. Here's a more 
detailed proposal:

1. Language contact trigger: The shift of stress to initial syllables (possibly 
   due to contact with an unknown substrate language that had initial stress)

2. Different pathways for different vowels:
   - High vowels *i, *u: devoicing → deletion
     - *mari > marḭ > mar
     - *taku > takṵ > tak
   
   - Mid vowels *e, *o: reduction to schwa → deletion
     - *mero > merə > mer
     - *toro > torə > tor

   - Low vowel *a: lengthening in stressed syllables, reduction elsewhere
     - *mála > maːl (stressed)
     - *malá > mal (unstressed)

This explains several patterns in the data:


```272:289:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
- thral [θral] "sacred, ritual; day" < Proto-Hick \*thralu → thral
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#historical-development))
  Note: Resists vowel reduction in compounds See: [Time Terms](#time--celestial)
- thren [θren] "watch, observe (ritual)" < Proto-Hick \*threnu → thren
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#historical-development))
  Note: Maintains [e] in unstressed positions
- wad [wad] "path, way" < Proto-Hick \*wadu → wad
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  See: [Maritime Terms](#maritime-terms)
- ward [ward] "direct, guide" < Proto-Hick \*wardu → ward
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  See: [Maritime Terms](#maritime-terms)
- thimer [θi.mer] "spiritual nurturing" < Proto-Hick \*ha-meru → thimer
  ([vowel reduction, stress shift](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#vowel-allophony))
  fusion, maintains second element due to sacred term) See:
  See: [Bird Terms](#bird-terms-nocturnal), [Kinship Terms](#kinship-terms)
  Note: Preserves original nurturing sense in sacred context
```


The sacred terms often show traces of original vowel length, suggesting the 
process was gradual and affected different social registers differently.

This also aligns with the Middle Hick period showing:


```75:82:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
## Middle Seneran (400 AI to 900 AI)
See: [Proto-Hick](@/languages/hick/proto-hick.md)
- Major sound changes:
  - Full unstressed vowel reduction
  - Resyllabification for CV preference
  - Systematic liquid/nasal deletion
  - Stress-related vowel lengthening
- Example: [in.nes.bel] → [i.ne.spel]
```


Would you like me to propose a detailed timeline for these changes?

## User:


[text]  
I would say they would be in an undefined/unresearched pre hick period. this would perhaps allow some construction of other sister languages to early hick, or at least dialectal variation


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

You make a great point. Looking at the historical development section 
(lines 30-92 in _index.md), we could revise it to be less definitive about the 
Pre-Hick stages and leave room for dialectal variation and sister languages.

Here's a proposed revision:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
# Historical Development

## Pre-Hick Period (before ~600 PF)
- Multiple dialectal varieties attested in place names
- Varying treatment of final vowels across dialects:
  - Northern varieties show early vowel reduction
  - Coastal dialects maintain final vowels longer
  - Inland varieties show consonant changes
- Exact developments remain uncertain
- Evidence for possible sister languages in regional toponyms

## Early Hick (~600 PF onward)
- Emergence of distinctive Early Hick features:
  - Loss of final vowels (through unclear intermediate stages)
  - Initial stress pattern crystallizes
  - Development of ergative system
- Core maritime and nature vocabulary established
- Complex compound system develops
- Sacred/ritual terminology crystallizes
```

This approach:
1. Acknowledges uncertainty in pre-600 PF developments
2. Allows for dialectal variation
3. Opens possibilities for sister languages
4. Makes the historical development more naturalistic

The existing stress patterns and compound formation rules (lines 175-244 in 
_index.md) would remain the same, but their origins would be less definitively 
stated.

Would you like me to show how to update other sections to reflect this more open 
historical framework?

## User:


[text]  
I would remove references to attestation in this document, to reflect some semblance of conceit that this is the current state of scholarship. 


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

You're right. We should revise the document to maintain the scholarly conceit. Let's focus on the key sections that need updating:


```12:20:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
The Hick language was the primary tongue of pre-Kalassarian Senera. While no
longer spoken, it survives in place names, maritime terminology, and religious
traditions throughout modern Senera.

A Kalassarian language grammatical sketch of Early and Middle Hick was
unearthed, along with a lexicon was found in an unsealed room underneath the
[Admiralty's Helm](@/locations/admiraltys-helm.md) in
[Surrey-on-the-Brams](@/locations/surrey-on-the-brams.md). Details in this is a
modern analysis of that sketch using modern linguistic methods.
```

This section should be revised to remove direct references to attestation and the Kalassarian grammatical sketch. Instead:

```markdown
# Overview

The Hick language was the primary tongue of pre-Kalassarian Senera. While no 
longer spoken, it survives in place names, maritime terminology, and religious 
traditions throughout modern Senera.

Early Hick shows an ergative-absolutive alignment with rich derivational 
morphology and a sophisticated spatial reference system. Core grammatical 
relations are marked through suffixes, while derivational processes primarily 
use prefixes.

A reconstruction of Proto-Hick has been proposed based on regional dialectal 
evidence and comparative analysis with other pre-Kalassarian languages of the 
region.
```

Similarly, in the lexicon document:


```12:15:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
The Early Hick lexicon, as attested, consists of mostly noun forms. These nouns
can represent a wide range of meanings, including actions, properties, or
relationships, which are traditionally the domain of verbs, adjectives, and
adverbs in other languages.
```

Should be revised to:

```markdown
# Early Hick Lexicon

The Early Hick lexicon consists primarily of noun forms. These nouns can 
represent a wide range of meanings, including actions, properties, or 
relationships, which are traditionally the domain of verbs, adjectives, and 
adverbs in other languages.
```

This maintains the scholarly tone while removing direct references to attestation 
or specific discoveries. Would you like me to continue with other sections that 
need similar revision?

## User:


[text]  
actually I think those sections are fine. I mean to say with attestation of dialects etc. the conceit is that we're working with a kalassarian era language sketch, somewhat expanded by modern seneran scholars in 1275 AI. they have yet to complete research on diaiectal evidence. in fact, to them the idea of historical linguistics may be only coming to fruition due to this relatively recent discovery


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Ah, I understand better now! You're right - the conceit is that this is based on a 
Kalassarian language sketch, being analyzed by 1275 AI Seneran scholars who are just 
beginning to develop historical linguistics as a field.

In that case, we should revise the Pre-Hick section to be more tentative. Looking at:


```27:44:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
A reconstruction of a hypothetical Proto-Hick is also provided, inferenced from
regional dialects and the historical development of Hick.

# Historical Development

## Pre-Hick Stage 1 (~1000-800 PF)

- Final vowels begin devoicing in unstressed syllables
- \*thralu > [ˈθra.lu̥]
- \*wardu > [ˈwar.du̥]
- \*taku > [ˈta.ku̥]

## Pre-Hick Stage 2 (~800-600 PF)

- Devoiced vowels reduce to schwa
- [ˈθra.lu̥] > [ˈθra.lə]
- [ˈwar.du̥] > [ˈwar.də]
- [ˈta.ku̥] > [ˈta.kə]
```


This section assumes too much knowledge of Pre-Hick developments. Here's a proposed 
revision:

```markdown
# Historical Development

## Pre-Hick Period (before ~600 PF)

While the exact developments remain unclear, comparison of Early Hick forms with 
remnant vocabulary suggests several possible sound changes:

- Loss of final vowels through unclear intermediate stages
- Development of initial stress pattern
- Possible vowel reduction processes

Further research into regional variations may shed light on these early 
developments.

## Early Hick (~600 PF onward)
```

This revision:
1. Maintains the conceit of 1275 AI scholarship
2. Acknowledges uncertainty about pre-600 PF developments
3. Hints at historical linguistics methods without fully deploying them
4. Leaves room for future "discoveries" about dialectal evidence

Would you like me to suggest revisions for other sections to maintain this 
scholarly perspective?
