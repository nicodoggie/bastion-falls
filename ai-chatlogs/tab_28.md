can we list known proto hick roots in @proto-hick.md ? check @hick for content


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

I'll help analyze the Proto-Hick roots from the provided content. Based on the documentation, here are the known Proto-Hick roots that should be listed in proto-hick.md:

- *fenu "four"
- *pilu "five"
- *seku "six"
- *pranu "seven"
- *kresu "eight"
- *kethu "hundred"
- *thranu "thousand"

## Grammatical Elements

- *mela "definite marker" > Early Hick -el (ergative)
- *heru "do, make" > Early Hick -'er (verbalizer)
- *hi- "animate prefix" > Early Hick i-/ʔ-
- *ha- "sacred prefix" > Early Hick θ- (th-)

## Notes

1. All Proto-Hick roots show:
   - Final vowel (usually *-u)
   - (C)CV(C)V structure
   - No complex onsets or codas
   - Fixed initial stress

2. Sound changes to Early Hick include:
   - Final vowel loss (*-u > ∅)
   - Initial fricative loss (*x- > h- > ∅)
   - Vowel coalescence (*ahi > ai)
   - Compound-specific changes (liquid/nasal deletion)

3. Semantic domains preserved:
   - Natural features
   - Sacred/ritual terminology
   - Basic actions
   - Numbers
   - Grammatical markers

This reconstruction is based on evidence from:


```6:13:site/content/languages/hick/proto-hick.md
_Proto-Hick_ is a hypothetical reconstructed language that represents the
ancestral language of the Hickic languages.

The current state of its reconstruction is highly speculative, as all evidence
are from only one line of descent: Early Hick. There are plans to document more
Seneran dialects to increase the robustness of the reconstruction. There may be
some evidence that Sanerian languages and dialects may be related to Hickic, but
more research is needed to confirm this.
```


And the sound changes are documented in:


```92:175:site/content/languages/hick/proto-hick.md
     - *tup → *tupu
```


The list combines explicit Proto-Hick forms given in the documentation with reconstructed forms based on the documented sound changes and Early Hick reflexes.

I think we have to restructure our systematic sound changes so we can track and apply them more systematically


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

You're right. Let's systematically organize the sound changes from Proto-Hick to Early Hick based on the documentation. I'll reference the relevant sections and propose a structured format.

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/proto-hick.md
# Sound Changes from Proto-Hick to Early Hick

## Chronological Stages

### Pre-Hick Period (before ~600 PF)

1. Final Vowel Devoicing
   - V → V̥ / _# in unstressed syllables
   - *thralu > [ˈθra.lu̥]
   - *wardu > [ˈwar.du̥]
   - *taku > [ˈta.ku̥]

2. Devoiced Vowel Reduction
   - V̥ → ə / _#
   - [ˈθra.lu̥] > [ˈθra.lə]
   - [ˈwar.du̥] > [ˈwar.də]
   - [ˈta.ku̥] > [ˈta.kə]

### Early Hick Period (~600 PF onward)

1. Final Schwa Deletion
   - ə → ∅ / _#
   - [ˈθra.lə] > [ˈθral]
   - [ˈwar.də] > [ˈward]
   - [ˈta.kə] > [ˈtak]

2. Initial Fricative Changes
   a. Animacy marker *hi-:
   - *hi- > ʔi- / #_i
   - *hi-C > ʔi-C[+voiced] / #_V
   - *hi- > ʔ- elsewhere
   
   b. Sacred marker *ha-:
   - *ha > θi / _C
   - *ha- > θ- elsewhere

3. Vowel Coalescence
   - *ahi > ai
   - *ahu > au
   - *grau > gra

4. Compound-Specific Changes
   a. Liquid Deletion:
   - r → ∅ / _C in compounds
   - tor-mal → tomal
   - val-mal → vamal
   
   b. Nasal Deletion:
   - N → ∅ / _C in compounds
   - bram-mal → bramal
   - bran-kel → brakel

5. Unstressed Vowel Reduction
   - a → ə in unstressed syllables
   - After sibilants and affricates
   - After voiceless stops
   - Between identical consonants
   - In grammatical prefixes

### Ordering Rules

1. Final vowel changes must precede compound formation
2. Initial fricative changes precede vowel coalescence
3. Compound-specific changes apply after basic sound changes
4. Unstressed vowel reduction applies last

## Special Cases

1. Sacred/ritual terms resist reduction
2. Maritime terms maintain second element weight
3. Recent compounds may preserve full weight
4. Morphological boundaries may preserve weight

## Exceptions

1. Stress-related preservation:
   - Stressed syllables maintain [a]
   - Sacred/formal terms resist reduction
   - Recent compounds preserve original forms

2. Compound-specific preservation:
   - Three-element compounds follow special rules
   - Maritime terminology preserves more archaic forms
```

This reconstruction is based on evidence from:


```32:52:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md

## Pre-Hick Period (before ~600 PF)

While the exact developments remain unclear, comparison of Early Hick forms with
remnant vocabulary suggests several possible sound changes:

1. Final vowels begin devoicing in unstressed syllables
   - \*thralu > [ˈθra.lu̥]
   - \*wardu > [ˈwar.du̥]
   - \*taku > [ˈta.ku̥]

2. Devoiced vowels reduce to schwa
   - [ˈθra.lu̥] > [ˈθra.lə]
   - [ˈwar.du̥] > [ˈwar.də]
   - [ˈta.ku̥] > [ˈta.kə]

## Early Hick (~600 PF onward)

1. Final schwa deletion
   - [ˈθra.lə] > [ˈθral]
   - [ˈwar.də] > [ˈward]
```


And compound changes from:


```663:672:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md

### Compound Formation

- Basic Pattern: modifier-head
- Sound changes:
  - Liquid deletion: tor-mal → tomal
  - Nasal deletion: bram-mal → bramal Examples:
- kur-tin → kurtin "bronze" (copper-tin)
- bram-mater → brammater "river vessel" (tide-vessel)
- thral-kel → thrakel "sun" (sacred-sky)
```


The systematic organization helps track the chronological development and interactions between different sound changes, making it easier to apply them consistently in reconstructions.
