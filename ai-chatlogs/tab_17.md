what is quenya and sindarin for elves?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Let me share what I know about Elvish languages in a conversational way!

In Tolkien's legendarium, the Elves are called _Quendi_ in primitive Elvish, meaning "those 
who speak with voices." But you're asking specifically about Quenya and Sindarin terms:

In Quenya:
- _Eldar_ (singular _Elda_) - the main word for Elves
- _Quendi_ - used more broadly for all Elves
- _Eldalie_ - the Elven folk/people

In Sindarin:
- _Edhil_ (singular _Edhel_) - the general word for Elves
- _Eldar_ - used specifically for the "high elves" who went to Aman
- _Moriquendi_ - "Dark Elves" who never saw the light of the Two Trees

Interestingly, the word "elf" itself doesn't have a direct translation - these terms are 
what the Elves called themselves in their own languages. The word "elf" comes from 
Germanic languages and was used by Tolkien as the English translation for these Elvish 
terms.

Would you like to know more about specific dialects or the historical development of 
these terms?

sindarin is what is used primarily by the elves of middle earth, correct?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, that's right! Let me explain why Sindarin became the more common language.

Quenya was the "high speech" or ancient tongue, like a medieval Latin equivalent, but 
Sindarin became the everyday language of most Elves in Middle-earth for a few key 
reasons:

1. Historical events: After the Noldor returned to Middle-earth, King Thingol banned 
   the use of Quenya when he learned of the Kinslaying at Alqualondë. This forced the 
   Noldor to adopt Sindarin.

2. Practical usage: Sindarin was already the common language of the Sindar (Grey 
   Elves) who never left Middle-earth. These elves were more numerous and had 
   established realms.

3. Cultural exchange: Sindarin became the language of diplomacy between Elves and 
   other races, especially humans. Many place names we know (like _Minas Tirith_ or 
   _Barad-dûr_) are in Sindarin.

By the Third Age (when _The Lord of the Rings_ takes place), Quenya was mostly used 
for ceremony, lore, and songs - similar to how Latin was used in medieval Europe. 
Sindarin was the living, everyday language of the Elves and educated humans in places 
like Gondor.

there isn't a collective term like Eldalie in Sindaring?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Actually, there is! In Sindarin, the collective term for "Elven-folk" or "all Elves" is 
_Edhellen_ or _Eldrim_.

However, Sindarin tends to use more specific terms to distinguish different groups of 
Elves:

- _Golodhrim_ - the Noldor
- _Iathrim_ - the Sindar of Doriath
- _Mithrim_ - the Sindar of Mithrim
- _Tawarwaith_ - the Wood-elves

The suffix _-rim_ in Sindarin serves a similar function to the Quenya _-lie_, denoting 
"people" or "folk." You'll notice this pattern in many Sindarin collective terms.

It's worth noting that Sindarin evolved to be more practical and specific in its 
terminology, while Quenya retained more poetic and broad terms - reflecting their 
different cultural roles (everyday speech vs ceremonial language).

it's a collectivizer suffix?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Yes, exactly! The suffix _-rim_ is a collectivizer in Sindarin. It's fascinating how it 
works - let me break it down:

_-rim_ turns singular nouns into collective plurals, specifically for groups or peoples. 
Some examples:

- _golodh_ (Noldo) → _Golodhrim_ (the Noldor as a people)
- _avar_ (one who refused the journey) → _Avari/Avarim_ (the Refusers as a group)
- _orodben_ (mountain person) → _Orodrim_ (mountain people)

Sindarin has other plural patterns too:
- Regular plural with _-in_ or _-ath_
- Dual with _-ad_
- But _-rim_ specifically indicates a collective people or race

This is different from Quenya's _-lie_, which is more abstract and poetic. Quenya also 
uses _-ar_ for some collectives, like in _Valar_.

The development of these suffixes reflects how Tolkien drew inspiration from real 
linguistic patterns - many languages have special markers for collective groups versus 
simple plurals!

is there a distinction between Eldhellen and Eldrim? or is this a dialectal shift?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



This is a fascinating linguistic question! Let me break down what we know:

_Edhellen_ (note the 'dh' rather than 'd') is actually an adjectival form meaning 
"elvish" or "of the elves," rather than a true collective noun. You see this in 
compounds like _Taith Edhellen_ (Elvish letters).

_Eldrim_ is the proper collective noun for "the Elven-folk" as a people.

The distinction is grammatical:
- _Edhellen_ = adjective ("elvish")
- _Edhil_ = plural ("elves")
- _Eldrim_ = collective ("elven-folk" as a unified group)

However, there's some scholarly debate about these forms because Tolkien revised his 
languages over time. What might look like dialectal variations sometimes reflect his 
evolving ideas about how the languages should work.

The shift from 'dh' to 'd' in some forms (_edhel_ vs _elder_) does appear to reflect 
actual sound changes within the history of Sindarin, similar to how real languages 
evolve over time.

Would you like me to elaborate on how these sound changes worked in Sindarin's 
development?
