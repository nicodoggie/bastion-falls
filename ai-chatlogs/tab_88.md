The Silent Ages traditionally refer to the years between the [Fall of the Western Kalassarian Empire](@/events/fall-of-the-western-kalassarian-empire.md) and the [Fall of Bastion](@/events/fall-of-bastion.md). Recent scholarship argue, however, that the age should be defined by the earliest evidence of the disappearance of magic from Thera, and tail-ended by its return, which does coincide with the Fall of Bastion.

This would put the earliest estimation of the Silent Ages to be from 435 AI to 1225 AI.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
MD013/line-length: Line length [Expected: 80; Actual: 418]
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

I'll help break up those long lines to meet the 80-character limit. Here's the edited version:

```markdown:site/content/concepts/silent-ages.md

Kalassarian Empire](@/events/fall-of-the-western-kalassarian-empire.md) and the

I've broken the long paragraph into multiple lines, each under 80 characters, while maintaining the markdown link syntax. The content remains exactly the same, just reformatted for better readability.
