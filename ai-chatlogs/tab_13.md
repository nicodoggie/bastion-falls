[text]  
I've been putting off doing complex clauses for too long at this point of developing @early-hick .

I want to explore starting with dependent clauses.
For example
"Before the cow and the horse grazed the meadows of Rannek, our people herded goats."


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Let me help you develop dependent clauses for Early Hick based on the provided documentation. From analyzing the available lexicon and grammar, I'll help construct this complex clause structure.

Key relevant sections from the documentation:

````307:338:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

## Ergative-Absolutive Alignment

- -el [el] (ERG): marks agent of transitive verbs
- -es [es] (ABS): marks patient of transitive & sole argument of intransitive

Early Hick can be described as a language with an ergative-absolutive alignment.
Languages with this alignment treat the "subject" of an intransitive verb like
the "object" of a transitive verb. This "object" or "patient" referent is marked
with the _absolutive_ case marker -es. The "subject" or "agent" referent is
marked with the _ergative_ case marker -el.

```plaintext
materokel 'al-es venitar
handler-ERG person-ABS burden.SUP
"The handler carries the person"
```

In the above example, the handler _materok_ is the agent of the verb "to carry"
and is marked with the ergative case marker -el. The person _'al_ is the patient
of the verb and is marked with the absolutive case marker -es.

```plaintext
'ales barak'er
person-ABS walk-VERB
"The person walks"
```

The single argument of the intransitive verb _barak'er_ is the one performing
the action, but because Early Hick is an ergative-absolutive language, the
absolutive case marker -es is used to mark the referent.

````

This shows the basic ergative-absolutive alignment.


```1161:1166:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
- gras [gras] "grass" < Proto-Hick \*grasu → gras
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Basic pastoral term. Forms two verbs:
  - gras'er "to graze" (animal eating grass)
  - grasaes "to herd, take to graze" (from illative: 'into grazing') See also
    [Action Terms](#action-terms)
```

This gives us the term for "graze" (gras'er).

Let's break down the complex sentence structure:

1. Main components needed:
- Temporal subordinator ("before")
- Coordination ("and")
- Ergative-absolutive case marking
- Verb forms

Here's my proposed structure for Early Hick dependent clauses:

1. Temporal subordinators should precede their clause
2. Use ru [ru] as the basic coordinator ("and")
3. Maintain ergative-absolutive alignment in both clauses

Proposed translation structure:

```plaintext
tel-imris [cow ru horse]-el Rannek gras-es gras'er, ma'al-es gras-aes
time-ELL [cow and horse]-ERG Rannek meadow-ABS graze-VERB, tribe-ABS graze-ILL

"Before the cow and horse grazed the meadows of Rannek, our people (took to) grazing"
```

Key features:
- tel-imris: "before" (literally "from-time")
- Coordination with ru
- Ergative marking on the compound subject [cow ru horse]-el
- Absolutive marking on "meadows" (gras-es)
- Use of illative -aes to indicate "take to grazing" in the main clause

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this structure or explore alternative constructions?

## User:


[text]  
I was thinking that the word for before was 'atelbran WHEN.dawn


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the lexicon and grammar documentation, I can help refine the dependent clause structure. Let's analyze the components:


````819:834:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

2. Information Structure

   - Initial position: topic/focus or temporal frame
   - Final position: new information or emphasis
   - Examples:

     ```plaintext
     branum bramisimris kethes
     past    river-ELL    sea-ABS
     "In the past, the river flowed to the sea" (temporal frame first)

     kethes bramisimris branum
     sea-ABS river-ELL    past
     "The river flowed to the sea, in the past" (neutral statement)
     ```
````

This shows us that Early Hick uses initial position for temporal frames.

For "before", your suggestion of 'atelbran (WHEN.dawn) is interesting, but looking at the temporal system:


````422:456:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Temporal System

### Tense Marking

See: [Clause Structure and Word Order](#clause-structure-and-word-order)

The basic temporal markers are added to the beginning of a clause to indicate
the time of the action.

| Tense Marker | Meaning  |
| ------------ | -------- |
| branum       | past     |
| branrum      | far past |
| mulsum       | future   |

```plaintext
branum 'ales venitar
PAST person-ABS yoke-SUPE
PAST person lift
"The person lifted."
```

```plaintext
branrum 'ales venitar
FAR PAST person-ABS yoke-SUPE
FAR PAST person lifted
"The person lifted long ago."
```

```plaintext
mulsum 'ales venitar
FUT person-ABS yoke-SUPE
"The person will lift."
```

````

We see that Early Hick has established temporal markers, including branum (past) and branrum (far past).

Let's construct the dependent clause "Before the cow and horse grazed the meadows of Rannek":

```plaintext
'atelbran [cow ru horse]-el Rannek gras-es gras'er
WHEN.dawn [cow and horse]-ERG Rannek grass-ABS graze-VERB
```

Key features:
1. 'atelbran as temporal subordinator (WHEN.dawn)
2. Coordination with ru
3. Ergative marking on compound subject [cow ru horse]-el
4. Absolutive marking on "grass" (gras-es)
5. Verb gras'er from the pastoral vocabulary:


```1161:1166:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
- gras [gras] "grass" < Proto-Hick \*grasu → gras
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Basic pastoral term. Forms two verbs:
  - gras'er "to graze" (animal eating grass)
  - grasaes "to herd, take to graze" (from illative: 'into grazing') See also
    [Action Terms](#action-terms)
```


Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this construction or explore alternative ways to express "before" in Early Hick?

## User:


[text]  
I haven't wrote it yet, but I was thinking that the coordinator would be used as ru-el cow o horse o, where the o is similar in use as japanese particle mo


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the code, I see the coordinator ru is defined here:


```174:175:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
- ru [ru] "and" < Proto-Hick \*storu → ru Note: Grammaticalized from "grow"
  sense through semantic bleaching See: [Basic Terms](#basic-terms)
```


Your suggestion of using ru-el with o particles is interesting. Given Early Hick's ergative-absolutive alignment and the fact that ru grammaticalized from "grow", we could analyze the structure:

```plaintext
[cow o horse o]-el ru-el gras-es gras'er
[cow PART horse PART]-ERG and-ERG grass-ABS graze-VERB
```

The particle o could work well here since:

1. Early Hick shows evidence of grammaticalization (like ru from "grow")
2. The language allows complex compound subjects to take single case marking
3. The information structure rules shown here:


````820:834:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
2. Information Structure

   - Initial position: topic/focus or temporal frame
   - Final position: new information or emphasis
   - Examples:

     ```plaintext
     branum bramisimris kethes
     past    river-ELL    sea-ABS
     "In the past, the river flowed to the sea" (temporal frame first)

     kethes bramisimris branum
     sea-ABS river-ELL    past
     "The river flowed to the sea, in the past" (neutral statement)
     ```
````


suggest that topic/focus marking through particles would fit the language's typology.

Would you like me to explore:
1. How this o particle might interact with other case markers?
2. Whether it should show vowel reduction like other grammatical elements?
3. Alternative coordination strategies based on the existing grammar?

     kethes bramisimris branum
     sea-ABS river-ELL    past
     "The river flowed to the sea, in the past" (neutral statement)
     ```
````

Shows that temporal frames go in initial position.


```780:784:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
- 'atelbran [ʔa.tel.bran] "before (when-dawn)" < 'aka-tel-bran → 'akatelbran →

  Note: Shows temporal metaphor of dawn/past, derived from interrogative See:
  [Time Terms](#time--celestial), [Interrogatives](#interrogatives)
```

Gives us 'atelbran for "before" (when-dawn).


```1161:1166:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
- gras [gras] "grass" < Proto-Hick \*grasu → gras
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  Note: Basic pastoral term. Forms two verbs:
  - gras'er "to graze" (animal eating grass)
  - grasaes "to herd, take to graze" (from illative: 'into grazing') See also
    [Action Terms](#action-terms)
```

Shows gras'er for "graze" and grasaes for "herd/take to graze".

For the coordinator with particle o, let's construct:

```plaintext
'atelbran [cow o horse o]-el Rannek gras-es gras'er, ma'al-es grasaes
WHEN.dawn [cow PART horse PART]-ERG Rannek grass-ABS graze-VERB, people-ABS herd-ILL

"Before the cow and horse grazed the meadows of Rannek, our people herded"
```

Key features:
1. 'atelbran as temporal subordinator
2. Coordination with particle o marking each coordinated noun
3. Single ergative case -el on the entire coordinated phrase
4. Absolutive marking on gras-es (grass/meadow)
5. Contrast between gras'er (graze) and grasaes (herd/take to graze)

Would you like me to explore:
1. Alternative word orders within the dependent clause?
2. How the particle o might interact with other case markers?
3. Other ways to express the temporal relationship?

I was suggested to structure dependent clauses like Basque, where the verb in the dependent clause uses a nominal form

'atelimris duwes, 'al'ises vinudimris branum
after eating, person-PROX.ANIM-ABS dwelling-ELL PAST


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the code, I see several relevant sections that help us understand how to structure dependent clauses:


````819:834:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

     kethes bramisimris branum
     sea-ABS river-ELL    past
     "The river flowed to the sea, in the past" (neutral statement)
     ```
````

Shows that temporal frames go in initial position.


```616:628:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

Early Hick's spatial case system interacts closely with verbal semantics,
marking not only physical direction but also abstrac
causation.

1. Basic Spatial Cases

   - -aes (ILL): "inward, into"
   - -imris (ELL): "outward, from"
   - -itar (SUPE): "upward, upon"
   - -asam (SUBE): "downward, onto"
   - -esp (SUB): "under, below"

```

Shows the spatial case system, including -imris (ELL) for "from, out of".

Your suggestion to structure dependent clauses like Basque using nominalized verbs with case marking is elegant and fits well with Early Hick's existing patterns. Let's analyze your example:

```plaintext
'atelimris duwes, 'al'ises vinudimris branum
after eating, person-PROX.ANIM-ABS dwelling-ELL PAST
```

This works well because:

1. Uses -imris (ellative) to mark "after" temporally
2. Nominalizes the dependent verb (duwes)
3. Maintains ergative-absolutive alignment in main clause
4. Places temporal frame in initial position

For "Before the cow and horse grazed the meadows of Rannek", we could structure:

```plaintext
[cow o horse o]-el gras'er-es 'atelimris, ma'al-es grasaes branum
[cow PART horse PART]-ERG graze-ABS before-ELL, people-ABS herd.ILL PAST

"Before the cow and horse's grazing, our people herded"
```

Would you like me to explore:
1. Other case markers that could work for temporal subordination?
2. How different word orders might affect the meaning?
3. Alternative ways to nominalize the dependent verbs?

## User:

- -aes (ILL): "inward, into"
- -imris,-iter (ELL): "outward, from"
- -itar (SUPE): "upward, upon"
- -esp (SUB): "under, below"

```

Shows the spatial cases, including -imris (ELL) for "outward, from".

Your construction:
```plaintext
ruel kor o toren o 'atelimris gras'er-es, ma'-al-'is-el grasaes samerok-es branum
AND-ERG [cow PART horse PART] AFTER grazing-ABS, PLURAL-person-PROX.ANIM-ERG herd goat-ABS PAST
```

A few observations:

1. The use of ru-el seems redundant with the particle o - typically we'd expect just one coordination strategy
2. The temporal marker should probably come first based on information structure rules
3. The verb nominalization with -es (ABS) is good, following the Basque-like pattern

Suggested revision:

```plaintext
[kor o toren o] gras'er-es 'atelimris, ma'al-'is-el samerok-es grasaes branum
[cow PART horse PART] graze-ABS AFTER-ELL, PLURAL-person-PROX.ANIM-ERG goat-ABS herd PAST
```

Key changes:
1. Removed redundant ru-el
2. Kept the particle o coordination
3. Maintained the nominalized verb with -es
4. Placed temporal marker 'atelimris after the nominalized action
5. Used ma'al-'is for "our people" with proximate animate marker

Would you like me to explain any of these changes in more detail?

## User:


[text]  
like I mentioned, o is like japanese mo, which is used to mark elements being coordinated. the temporal marker may be initial or final depending on emphasis


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Thanks for the clarification. Looking at the information structure rules:


````820:834:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
2. Information Structure

   - Initial position: topic/focus or temporal frame
   - Final position: new information or emphasis

     past    river-ELL    sea-ABS
     "In the past, the river flowed to the sea" (temporal frame first)

     kethes bramisimris branum
     sea-ABS river-ELL    past
     "The river flowed to the sea, in the past" (neutral statement)
     ```
````


And the temporal positioning rules:


````859:877:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - Time words can float freely but tend toward:
     - Initial: setting temporal frame for discourse
     - Pre-verbal: marking temporal contrast
     - Final: neutral narrative position
   - Examples:

     ```plaintext
     branum materok-el ward-ʔer  # Frame-setting
     past    handler-ERG guide-VERB
     "In the past, the handler guided"

     materok-el branum ward-ʔer  # Temporal contrast
     handler-ERG past    guide-ACT
     "The handler USED TO guide"

     materok-el ward-ʔer branum  # Neutral narrative
     handler-ERG guide-ACT past
     "The handler guided, in the past"
     ```
````


We can construct two versions of the sentence with different emphasis:

1. Temporal frame emphasis:
```plaintext
'atelbran [kor o toren o] gras'er-es, ma'al-'is-el samerok-es grasaes
WHEN.dawn [cow PART horse PART] graze-ABS, PLURAL-person-PROX.ANIM-ERG goat-ABS herd
```

2. Neutral narrative:
```plaintext
[kor o toren o] gras'er-es, ma'al-'is-el samerok-es grasaes 'atelbran
[cow PART horse PART] graze-ABS, PLURAL-person-PROX.ANIM-ERG goat-ABS herd WHEN.dawn
```

Key features:
1. Particle o marking each coordinated element (like Japanese も)
2. Nominalized verb gras'er-es with absolutive case
3. Ergative marking on ma'al-'is-el (our people)
4. Absolutive marking on samerok-es (goats)
5. Position of 'atelbran varies based on emphasis

Would you like me to explore:
1. Alternative positions for the particle o?
2. Other ways to mark the coordination?
3. Different case marking patterns?

## User:


[text]  
I still like having ru to mean additive coordination. I still haven't constructed a word for alternation, but the o still marks the arguments for the coordination

     handler-ERG guide-ACT past
     "The handler guided, in the past"
     ```
````


Shows that temporal markers can float based on emphasis.

So for the sentence "Before the cow and horse grazed the meadows of Rannek, our people herded goats", we could have:

```plaintext
'atelbran ru [kor o toren o]-el gras'er-es, ma'al-'is-el samerok-es grasaes
WHEN.dawn AND [cow PART horse PART]-ERG graze-ABS, people-PROX.ANIM-ERG goat-ABS herd

"Before the cow and horse grazed, our people herded goats"
```

Key features:
1. 'atelbran as temporal subordinator
2. ru as additive coordinator
3. o particles marking coordinated elements
4. -el ergative on the entire coordinated phrase
5. -es absolutive on the nominalized verb gras'er

Or with temporal frame final for neutral narrative:

```plaintext
ru [kor o toren o]-el gras'er-es, ma'al-'is-el samerok-es grasaes 'atelbran
AND [cow PART horse PART]-ERG graze-ABS, people-PROX.ANIM-ERG goat-ABS herd WHEN.dawn
```

Would you like me to explore:
1. Other positions for ru?
2. How this structure might work with other types of coordination?
3. Alternative ways to mark the dependent clause?

## User:


[text]  
would it be terrible if the coordination word ru holds the ergative marker instead of the arguments?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the ergative-absolutive alignment rules and case marking patterns:


````308:337:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Ergative-Absolutive Alignment

- -el [el] (ERG): marks agent of transitive verbs
- -es [es] (ABS): marks patient of transitive & sole argument of intransitive

Early Hick can be described as a language with an ergative-absolutive alignment.
Languages with this alignment treat the "subject" of an intransitive verb like
the "object" of a transitive verb. This "object" or "patient" referent is marked
with the _absolutive_ case marker -es. The "subject" or "agent" referent is
marked with the _ergative_ case marker -el.

```plaintext
materokel 'al-es venitar
handler-ERG person-ABS burden.SUP
"The handler carries the person"
```

In the above example, the handler _materok_ is the agent of the verb "to carry"
and is marked with the ergative case marker -el. The person _'al_ is the patient
of the verb and is marked with the absolutive case marker -es.

```plaintext
'ales barak'er
person-ABS walk-VERB
"The person walks"
```

The single argument of the intransitive verb _barak'er_ is the one performing
the action, but because Early Hick is an ergative-absolutive language, the
absolutive case marker -es is used to mark the referent.
````


And the conjunction ru's etymology:


```174:175:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
- ru [ru] "and" < Proto-Hick \*storu → ru Note: Grammaticalized from "grow"
  sense through semantic bleaching See: [Basic Terms](#basic-terms)
```


Having ru take the ergative marker could work because:

1. ru grammaticalized from "grow", suggesting it can take on grammatical functions
2. The ergative marks the agent of transitive verbs, and coordination could be seen as an agent-like function
3. Early Hick allows flexible word order and case marking patterns

So instead of:
```plaintext
[kor o toren o]-el gras'er-es
[cow PART horse PART]-ERG graze-ABS
```

We could have:
```plaintext
kor o toren o ru-el gras'er-es
cow PART horse PART AND-ERG graze-ABS
```

This is typologically unusual but not impossible, especially given:
1. The language's flexible word order
2. The grammaticalization path of ru from "grow"
3. The particle o already marking the coordinated elements

Would you like me to explore:
1. How this might interact with other case markers?
2. Whether this pattern could extend to other types of coordination?
3. The implications for complex clauses?

## User:


[text]  
so ru in post position after the arguments is more likely than in preposition?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the code, particularly the information structure patterns:



````819:834:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

2. Information Structure

   - Initial position: topic/focus or temporal frame
   - Final position: new information or emphasis
   - Examples:

     ```plaintext
     branum bramisimris kethes
     past    river-ELL    sea-ABS
     "In the past, the river flowed to the sea" (temporal frame first)

     kethes bramisimris branum
     sea-ABS river-ELL    past
     "The river flowed to the sea, in the past" (neutral statement)
     ```
````


And the etymology of ru:


```174:175:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
- ru [ru] "and" < Proto-Hick \*storu → ru Note: Grammaticalized from "grow"
  sense through semantic bleaching See: [Basic Terms](#basic-terms)
```


Yes, ru in post-position after the arguments would be more natural because:

1. The language shows a preference for marking relationships after their arguments (like case markers)
2. ru grammaticalized from "grow", suggesting it developed as a relational marker
3. The information structure prefers marking functional elements after content words

So instead of:
```plaintext
ru [kor o toren o]-el gras'er-es
AND [cow PART horse PART]-ERG graze-ABS
```

We should have:
```plaintext
[kor o toren o] ru-el gras'er-es
[cow PART horse PART] AND-ERG graze-ABS
```

This follows the same pattern we see in other constructions where functional markers follow their arguments. Would you like me to explore:
1. How this interacts with other case markers?

I'll explore how ru in post-position might interact with other case markers.

Looking at the case system and morphological rules:


```389:395:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
The spatial cases are:

- -aes (ILL): "inward, into"
- -imris,-iter (ELL): "outward, from"
- -itar (SUPE): "upward, upon"
- -esp (SUB): "under, below"
- -asam (SUBE): "downward, onto"
```


And the suffix ordering rules:


```784:794:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
1. Inner Suffixes (closer to root)

   - -ok (AGENT): agentive
   - -er (ACT): active participant

2. Outer Suffixes (final position)
   - -el (ERG): ergative case
   - -es (ABS): absolutive case
   - -imris (ELL): ellative case
   - -aes (ILL): illative case

```


When ru takes case markers in post-position, it should follow these patterns:

1. For ergative coordination:
```plaintext
[kor o toren o] ru-el gras'er-es
[cow PART horse PART] AND-ERG graze-ABS
```

2. For absolutive coordination:
```plaintext
[gras o mal o] ru-es ward'er
[grass PART pool PART] AND-ABS guide-VERB
```

3. For spatial cases:
```plaintext
[keth o bram o] ru-aes ward'er
[sea PART river PART] AND-ILL guide-VERB
"guide into (both) sea and river"
```

4. For multiple case-marked coordinations:
```plaintext
[materok o gal o] ru-el [rismater o mal o] ru-es ward'er
[handler PART man PART] AND-ERG [boat PART pool PART] AND-ABS guide-VERB
"The handler and man guide the boat and pool"
```

This pattern:
1. Maintains ergative-absolutive alignment
2. Follows suffix ordering rules
3. Allows ru to take any case marker that normal nouns can take
4. Preserves the particle o as coordinator marker
5. Keeps functional elements (case markers) in final position

Would you like me to explore the other option - how this might work with different types of coordination?

## User:


[text]  
would ru be able to conjoin two independent clauses?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, looking at the information structure and clause patterns:


````819:834:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

2. Information Structure

   - Initial position: topic/focus or temporal frame
   - Final position: new information or emphasis
   - Examples:

     ```plaintext
     branum bramisimris kethes
     past    river-ELL    sea-ABS
     "In the past, the river flowed to the sea" (temporal frame first)

     kethes bramisimris branum
     sea-ABS river-ELL    past
     "The river flowed to the sea, in the past" (neutral statement)
     ```
````


And the temporal positioning rules:


````859:877:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - Time words can float freely but tend toward:
     - Initial: setting temporal frame for discourse
     - Pre-verbal: marking temporal contrast
     - Final: neutral narrative position
   - Examples:

     ```plaintext
     branum materok-el ward-ʔer  # Frame-setting
     past    handler-ERG guide-VERB
     "In the past, the handler guided"

     materok-el branum ward-ʔer  # Temporal contrast
     handler-ERG past    guide-ACT
     "The handler USED TO guide"

     materok-el ward-ʔer branum  # Neutral narrative
     handler-ERG guide-ACT past
     "The handler guided, in the past"
     ```
````


ru should be able to conjoin independent clauses. Since ru grammaticalized from "grow" and can take case marking, it would work well as a clause coordinator.

For example:
```plaintext
[kor o toren o] gras'er-es 'atelimris ru-el, ma'al-'is-el samerok-es grasaes
[cow PART horse PART] graze-ABS AFTER-ELL AND-ERG, people-PROX.ANIM-ERG goat-ABS herd

"After the cow and horse grazed, and our people herded goats"
```

The ru-el taking ergative case here shows it's functioning as a coordinator between two independent clauses, similar to how it coordinates noun phrases.

This follows Early Hick's patterns where:
1. Functional elements can take case marking
2. Word order signals pragmatic rather than grammatical functions
3. Case marking shows grammatical relationships

Would you like me to explore:
1. How ru might coordinate clauses with different cases?
2. Whether ru could take other case markers in clause coordination?
3. Alternative positions for ru in clause coordination?

Looking at the ergative-absolutive alignment rules:


````314:338:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
Languages with this alignment treat the "subject" of an intransitive verb like
the "object" of a transitive verb. This "object" or "patient" referent is marked

marked with the _ergative_ case marker -el.

```plaintext

In the above example, the handler _materok_ is the agent of the verb "to carry"

of the verb and is marked with the absolutive case marker -es.

```plaintext

Your construction looks good, but I have a few suggestions:

1. Since ru can conjoin independent clauses, we could use it here:
```plaintext

PLURAL-person.PROX.ANIM-ERG graze Rannek-POSS meadow-ABS AND-ERG, march-VERB-ILL PLURAL-season-ABS
```

Key points:
- ru-el marks the coordination of two clauses with shared ergative argument
- -ul possessive on Ranek
- -aes illative case marking directional motion "into/along with"
- ma- plural prefix on both thral "season" and 'al'is "our people"
- Maintains ergative-absolutive alignment across both clauses

Would you like me to explore:
1. Alternative positions for ru?
2. Other ways to mark the shared argument?

Yes, you can share the absolutive argument between clauses! Your construction:

kor-es gras'er 'al'is-el ru-es gras-aes wen'altar-el
cow-ABS graze person-ERG AND-ABS herd-ILL woman.DIST.ANIM-ERG

This works because:

1. kor-es is the shared absolutive argument (patient of both verbs)
2. ru-es takes the absolutive case to show it's coordinating shared absolutive arguments
3. Each clause has its own ergative agent ('al'is-el and wen'altar-el)
4. The illative -aes on gras shows the directional nature of herding

Your sentence has a few issues:

1. ka'irek is redundant since 'irek'er already means "to stand firmly"

Yes, 'irek should come after the verb when modifying it as an adverbial concept. The property concept follows the verb it modifies, similar to how stative verbs work but without verbalization.

So the sentence should be:

```plaintext
wen'altanes 'irek'er 'irek litor-itar etal
woman.MED.VIS.ANIM-ABS stand-VERB firm hill-SUPE that.MED
"She stands firm upon that hill"
```

This works because:
1. Property concepts can modify verbs by following them
2. No verbalization is needed when 'irek acts as a modifier
3. The word order follows the pragmatic pattern where new information/emphasis comes later
4. The spatial case -itar still marks the location "upon"

Would you like me to explore:

- ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)

We could use ka'irek as an adverbial modifier. So the sentence would be:

```plaintext
wen'altanes 'irek'er ka'irek litor-itar etal
woman.MED.VIS.ANIM-ABS stand-VERB firm-SIM hill-SUPE that.MED
"She stands firm-like upon that hill"
```

This works because:
1. ka- prefix creates similarity/manner modifiers
2. When modifying verbs, these follow the verb they modify
3. The similarity prefix reduces to [kə] as expected
4. Maintains the ergative-absolutive alignment with intransitive verb

Would you like me to explore:
1. Other possible similarity-marked modifiers in this construction?
2. How this interacts with other verbal modifiers?
3. Alternative positions for emphasis?

so when we're using a property to modify a noun, would you suggest it go after the noun too? I've been using it prop first then noun then referent marking

Looking at the compound formation rules:

And the basic patterns:


```812:818:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
1. Basic Patterns

   - Core arguments marked by case, allowing flexible word order
   - Ergative (-el) marks agent of transitive verbs
   - Absolutive (-es) marks patient of transitive & sole argument of
     intransitive
   - Word order signals pragmatic functions rather than grammatical roles
```


You're actually correct - I apologize for my confusion earlier. For nominal modification, the modifier-head pattern is the basic structure. So your approach of putting the property first is the right way:

```plaintext
'irek litor-es etal
firm hill-ABS that.MED
"that firm hill"
```

The post-verbal position of property concepts is specifically for when they're modifying verbs as adverbials (like with ka'irek).

This follows the language's patterns where:
1. Compounds follow modifier-head order
2. Case marking goes on the head noun
3. Demonstratives follow the entire nominal phrase

Would you like me to explore:
1. How this interacts with other types of nominal modification?
2. The difference between compound formation vs. modification?
3. How multiple modifiers would be ordered?

I like it. it'd be good to document in the early hick markdown document


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, I'll help document this pattern. Looking at the structure of the document, we should add this under the Core Grammar section, perhaps after the Verbal System (around line 359).

Here's the suggested addition:

```markdown
## Property Concepts and Modification

Early Hick uses property concepts in three distinct ways:

1. As Nominal Modifiers
   - Follow modifier-head order
   ```plaintext
   'irek litor-es etal
   firm hill-ABS that.MED
   "that firm hill"
   ```

2. As Verbalized Forms
   ```plaintext
   litor-es 'irek'er
   hill-ABS firm-VERB
   "The hill stands firm"
   ```

3. As Verbal Modifiers
   - Follow the verb they modify
   - Can take similarity prefix ka-
   ```plaintext
   wen'altanes 'irek'er ka'irek
   woman.MED.VIS.ANIM-ABS stand-VERB firm-SIM
   "She stands firm-like"
   ```

This pattern maintains the language's basic modifier-head order for nominal 
modification while allowing property concepts to function adverbially through 
post-verbal position and the similarity prefix ka-.
```

This addition:
1. References the compound formation rules (lines 237-246)
2. Follows the pattern of other grammatical descriptions
3. Provides clear examples following the established glossing format
4. Shows how property concepts interact with both nominal and verbal systems

Would you like me to:
1. Add more examples?
2. Expand on the interaction with case marking?
3. Add cross-references to other relevant sections?

could these be put in terms that typical english speakers understand? perhaps as adjectival and adverbial phrases?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, we can make it more accessible by framing it in familiar grammatical terms. Looking at the relevant sections:


```12:25:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
The Hick language was the primary tongue of pre-Kalassarian Senera. While no
longer spoken, it survives in place names, maritime terminology, and religious
traditions throughout modern Senera.

A Kalassarian language grammatical sketch of Early and Middle Hick was

[Admiralty's Helm](@/locations/admiraltys-helm.md) in

Early Hick shows an ergative-absolutive alignment with rich derivational
morphology and a sophisticated spatial reference system. Core grammatical
relations are marked through suffixes, while derivational processes primarily
use prefixes.
```


And the lexicon introduction:


```12:15:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
The Early Hick lexicon, as attested, consists of mostly noun forms. These nouns
can represent a wide range of meanings, including actions, properties, or
relationships, which are traditionally the domain of verbs, adjectives, and
adverbs in other languages.
```


Here's a clearer way to document this:

````markdown
## Property Words and Modification

Early Hick uses property words (like English adjectives and adverbs) in three 
main ways:

1. As Adjectives (modifying nouns)
   - Come before the noun they modify
   ```plaintext
   'irek litor-es etal
   firm hill-ABS that.MED
   "that firm hill" (like English "the tall tree")
   ```

2. As Predicate Adjectives (with verb marking)
   ```plaintext
   litor-es 'irek'er
   hill-ABS firm-VERB
   "The hill is firm" (like English "The tree is tall")
   ```

3. As Adverbs (modifying verbs)
   - Come after the verb they modify
   - Often take the similarity prefix ka-
   ```plaintext
   wen'altanes 'irek'er ka'irek
   woman.MED.VIS.ANIM-ABS stand-VERB firm-SIM
   "She stands firmly" (like English "-ly" adverbs)
   ```

This pattern means that word order shows whether a property word is acting like 
an adjective (before nouns) or an adverb (after verbs).

Would you like me to:
1. Add more everyday English examples for comparison?
2. Explain how this relates to other parts of speech?
3. Add a section about multiple modifiers?

## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Let me analyze this based on the grammar rules. Looking at:


```311:338:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

## Late Hick/Early Seneran (105 AI to 400 AI)
```

For spatial cases.

There are a few issues with the current construction:

1. The ergative case (-el) is used for agents of transitive verbs, but 'air' isn't really acting on anything here
2. The SUBE case (-asam) means "downward, onto" which isn't quite right for "lingering in"
3. We might want to use the similarity prefix ka- for "lingering" to give it that sense of "like floating"

Here's a suggested correction:

```plaintext
imul sinibeles thiriter ka'sin'er
evil-POSS taste-ABS air-SUPE float-SIM-VERB
"evil's taste floats lingeringly upon the air"
```

Where:
1. imul takes the possessive suffix
2. sinibeles is the absolutive subject of the intransitive verb
3. thiriter uses SUPE case "upon/in the air"
4. ka'sin'er uses the similarity prefix to give the sense of "float-like" or "lingering"

Would you like me to explore:
1. Alternative spatial cases for different nuances?
2. Other ways to express "lingering"?
3. Different word orders for emphasis?

## User:

I was trying to evoke a sense of the evil subtlely lying beneath the air. and since the word for general word for air does have a sense of sacredness because of the initial th, it does have connotations that say "evil lurks under even pureness"

Ah, I understand the poetic intent now. Looking at the relevant sections:


```390:397:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

The spatial cases are:

- -aes (ILL): "inward, into"
- -imris,-iter (ELL): "outward, from"

Given this poetic intent, we could structure it as:

```plaintext
imul sinibeles thirel-esp sin'er
evil-POSS taste-ABS sacred.air-SUB float-VERB
"evil's taste floats beneath the sacred air"

Where:
1. thirel uses the sacred th- initial, emphasizing the pure/sacred nature of air
2. -esp (SUB) specifically means "under, below" giving that sense of lurking
3. sin'er (float) without the ka- prefix makes it more direct and ominous
4. The absolutive case on sinibeles emphasizes it as the subject doing the floating

The word order and case marking create a powerful image of corruption lurking beneath purity. Would you like me to explore:
1. Alternative word orders for different emphasis?
2. Other sacred/profane contrasts we could incorporate?
3. How this might work with temporal markers to suggest duration?

Looking at the spatial case system and verb marking:


```390:396:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

The spatial cases are:

- -aes (ILL): "inward, into"
- -imris,-iter (ELL): "outward, from"

And the ergative-absolutive alignment:


````314:338:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

Early Hick can be described as a language with an ergative-absolutive alignment.
Languages with this alignment treat the "subject" of an intransitive verb like
the "object" of a transitive verb. This "object" or "patient" referent is marked
with the _absolutive_ case marker -es. The "subject" or "agent" referent is
marked with the _ergative_ case marker -el.

```plaintext
materokel 'al-es venitar
handler-ERG person-ABS burden.SUP
"The handler carries the person"
```

In the above example, the handler _materok_ is the agent of the verb "to carry"
and is marked with the ergative case marker -el. The person _'al_ is the patient
of the verb and is marked with the absolutive case marker -es.

```plaintext
'ales barak'er
person-ABS walk-VERB
"The person walks"
```

The single argument of the intransitive verb _barak'er_ is the one performing
the action, but because Early Hick is an ergative-absolutive language, the
````


You're right! The subessive case (-asam) should mark the verb to show the direction of the action. So we should restructure it as:

```plaintext
imul sinibeles thirel sin'erasam
evil-POSS taste-ABS sacred.air-ERG float-VERB-SUBE
"evil's taste is floated down upon by the sacred air"
```

However, this still isn't quite right because:
1. We want the air to be the location, not the agent
2. The evil taste should be what's doing the floating

A better structure would be:

```plaintext
imul sinibeles thiriter sin'er
evil-POSS taste-ABS sacred.air-SUPE float-VERB
"evil's taste floats upon the sacred air"
```

Or to specifically emphasize "under":

```plaintext
imul sinibeles sin'eresp thiriter
evil-POSS taste-ABS float-VERB-SUB sacred.air-SUPE
"evil's taste floats beneath upon the sacred air"
```

The -esp (SUB) on the verb indicates the direction/position of floating, while thiriter takes the superessive case to establish "upon the air" as the reference point.

Would you like me to explore:
1. Other spatial case combinations for different nuances?
2. Alternative word orders for emphasis?
3. How this interacts with temporal markers?
