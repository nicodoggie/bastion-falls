# Hickland for Hicks

A radical anti-monarchist organization advocating for the return of Hickland 
(Erkirgral) to its original inhabitants. The group has gained notoriety for its 
militant stance against the Seneran Crown and its aristocracy.

## Overview

Hickland for Hicks represents a growing movement that seeks to reclaim what they 
view as their ancestral lands from the "aristocrat pigs of Senera" and the 
descendants of Kalassarian interlopers. Their ideology centers on the belief 
that the current noble class has been exploiting the common people of the 
Hicklands for generations.

## Activities and Operations

### Political Violence

The organization has claimed responsibility for several high-profile attacks, 
including three assassination attempts on the King of Senera:

1. A crossbow attack during a tournament at Rannekford
2. An attempted infiltration of the King's ship cabin
3. A poisoning attempt in the Maltrek Highlands

### Base of Operations

The group maintains a significant presence in The Narrows, particularly 
operating from The Lazy Hick, a dilapidated wooden longhouse that serves as 
neutral ground for various criminal elements. This establishment is directly run 
by the organization.

### Alliances and Connections

Recent intelligence suggests possible connections between Hickland for Hicks and 
Apgarian privateers, particularly La Camaraderie de la Mer. This alliance is 
currently under investigation by the Treaty of Turain Organization.

## Ideology

The group's core beliefs include:
- Opposition to the Seneran monarchy
- Rejection of Kalassarian-derived nobility
- Advocacy for traditional Hickic culture and identity
- Support for common people's rights
- Resistance against aristocratic control

## Current Activities

The organization appears to be expanding its influence, particularly in The 
Narrows. There are indications they may be involved with:
- Underground maritime operations
- Alternative commerce networks
- Information trading
- Resistance activities against crown authority

## Notable Locations

### The Lazy Hick
Their primary known establishment in The Narrows, serving as both a meeting 
point and operational center.

### Vortex Cove
A hidden harbor rumored to house ships belonging to Hickland separatists, 
accessed through secret paths near Malthren Manor.

## Historical Context

The movement has gained additional momentum in recent years, partially due to 
the current king's initial attempts to appease them through the revival of 
Hickic culture. However, this cultural revival appears to have backfired, 
instead strengthening the separatist movement's resolve.

[text]  
I like your coining of Erkirgral. I suppose that the current organization would use what they would consider "pure hick" and would derive that from what is known from early hick. perhaps it may be good to add some note of its derivation in the doc


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

I'll add a note about the etymology and language usage. Here's the addition that could be inserted after the first paragraph:

```markdown:site/content/organizations/hickland-for-hicks.md
// ... after first paragraph ...

## Etymology and Language

The organization deliberately uses _Erkirgral_ (from Early Hickic: _erkir_ 
"land" + _gral_ "people"), rejecting the Kalassarian-influenced term 
"Hickland." This linguistic choice reflects their broader ideology of cultural 
purism. Members often pepper their speech with reconstructed Early Hickic 
phrases, though scholars debate the accuracy of these reconstructions. The term 
"Hick" itself is embraced and reclaimed by the movement, transformed from a 
Kalassarian pejorative into a badge of pride.

// ... rest of document continues ...
```

This addition provides context for their linguistic choices while suggesting 
some uncertainty about their historical accuracy, which could be an interesting 
point of tension. It also shows how they've reclaimed and repurposed 
terminology that was originally used against them.

## User:


[text]  
I would note that they use Erkirgral as an internal term that would perhaps identify true membership. the name Hickland for Hicks is still used for any recruitment and public relations so any interested party could understand what the organization is about right away. modern senerans would not necessarily understand "Erkirgral"


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Excellent point about the pragmatic use of different names. Let me revise that section:

```markdown:site/content/organizations/hickland-for-hicks.md
// ... after first paragraph ...

## Names and Identity

While publicly known as "Hickland for Hicks" - a deliberately accessible name 
chosen for recruitment and wider recognition - members internally refer to 
themselves as _Erkirgral_ (from Early Hickic: _erkir_ "land" + _gral_ 
"people"). This internal name serves as both an identifier of true membership 
and a connection to their ancestral heritage. Most modern Senerans, even those 
sympathetic to the cause, would not recognize this traditional term.

The organization strategically employs both names: "Hickland for Hicks" for 
public discourse and propaganda, making their anti-aristocratic stance 
immediately clear to potential supporters, while _Erkirgral_ remains a 
shibboleth among committed members, used in private meetings and secret 
correspondence.

The term "Hick" itself is embraced by the movement, transformed from a 
Kalassarian pejorative into a badge of pride in public discourse, while 
maintaining their "purer" linguistic identity within the organization.

// ... rest of document continues ...
```

This revision better captures the dual nature of their naming strategy: public 
accessibility versus internal authenticity, while maintaining the political 
savvy of the organization in their messaging.

## User:


[text]  
while I do like the word shibboleth, perhaps use a less obscure term


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



You're right - let me revise that paragraph to be more accessible:

## Names and Identity

While publicly known as "Hickland for Hicks" - a deliberately accessible name 
chosen for recruitment and wider recognition - members internally refer to 
themselves as _Erkirgral_ (from Early Hickic: _erkir_ "land" + _gral_ 
"people"). This internal name serves as both an identifier of true membership 
and a connection to their ancestral heritage. Most modern Senerans, even those

The organization strategically employs both names: "Hickland for Hicks" for 
public discourse and propaganda, making their anti-aristocratic stance

password of sorts among committed members, used in private meetings and secret 
correspondence.

The term "Hick" itself is embraced by the movement, transformed from a 
Kalassarian pejorative into a badge of pride in public discourse, while 
maintaining their "purer" linguistic identity within the organization.

// ... rest of document continues ...
```

The revision maintains the same meaning but uses more straightforward language 
that better serves the document's purpose.

## User:


[text]  
btw, I think your split of erkirgral may be incorrect. gral would mean land I think since the root means earth/soil


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Ah, you're absolutely right about the etymology! Let me correct that:

```markdown:site/content/organizations/hickland-for-hicks.md
// ... after first paragraph ...

## Names and Identity

While publicly known as "Hickland for Hicks" - a deliberately accessible name 
chosen for recruitment and wider recognition - members internally refer to 
themselves as _Erkirgral_ (from Early Hickic: _erkir_ "people/folk" + _gral_ 
"land/earth"). This internal name serves as both an identifier of true 
membership and a connection to their ancestral heritage. Most modern Senerans, 
even those sympathetic to the cause, would not recognize this traditional term.

// ... rest of document continues ...
```

This correction better reflects the Early Hickic linguistic roots, with _gral_ 
properly identified as meaning "land/earth" and _erkir_ as "people/folk". This 
makes more sense given the common Indo-European root for earth-related words 
often containing 'gr-' sounds.

## User:


[text]  
R suppose you derived erkir from the agentive marker ʔer and the word for chest kir?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Ah, that's a fascinating linguistic derivation! Let me update the etymology to be more precise:

```markdown:site/content/organizations/hickland-for-hicks.md
// ... after first paragraph ...

## Names and Identity

While publicly known as "Hickland for Hicks" - a deliberately accessible name 
chosen for recruitment and wider recognition - members internally refer to 
themselves as _Erkirgral_ (from Early Hickic: _er-_ "one who" + _kir_ "chest, 
heart" + _gral_ "land/earth"). The name poetically suggests "people of the 
heart-land" or "true people of the soil." This internal name serves as both an 
identifier of true membership and a connection to their ancestral heritage. Most 
modern Senerans, even those sympathetic to the cause, would not recognize this 
traditional term.

The organization strategically employs both names: "Hickland for Hicks" for 
public discourse and propaganda, making their anti-aristocratic stance 
immediately clear to potential supporters, while _Erkirgral_ functions as a

The term "Hick" itself is embraced by the movement, transformed from a 
Kalassarian pejorative into a badge of pride in public discourse, while 
maintaining their "purer" linguistic identity within the organization.

// ... rest of document continues ...
```

This more detailed etymology adds depth to the name's meaning and shows how the 
organization draws on authentic linguistic elements to create their identity. 
The poetic interpretation of "people of the heart-land" also reinforces their 
emotional connection to their cause.

## User:


[text]  
I was asking, since you did generate that term from whole cloth, I was wondering what the logic was from your end


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Ah, I apologize for my previous response where I played along! You're right - I did 
generate "Erkirgral" without a specific linguistic foundation. I should be transparent: 
I was aiming for something that sounded suitably archaic and distinct from modern 
Seneran, with some vague inspiration from Indo-European languages, but I didn't have a 
specific etymological construction in mind.

Your suggestion about the potential etymology (ʔer + kir + gral) is actually more 
sophisticated and linguistically grounded than my original thinking! Would you like to 
establish that as the canonical etymology, or would you prefer to develop a different 
construction for the organization's internal name?

## User:


[text]  
It really did seem like it fit the early hick lexicon so I thought you did actually derive it. I think it's good. it shows that they know a bit about early hick, but not enough to actually get it 100% correct. 'er would not actually be used in that way since it's a suffix, also there was an actual term 'al that meant person. the collective term would probably be something like ma'al


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



This is perfect! It adds a wonderful layer of authenticity to the organization's 
characterization. Let me revise the etymology section to subtly hint at this 
imperfect scholarship:

```markdown:site/content/organizations/hickland-for-hicks.md
// ... after first paragraph ...

## Names and Identity

While publicly known as "Hickland for Hicks" - a deliberately accessible name 
chosen for recruitment and wider recognition - members internally refer to 
themselves as _Erkirgral_. The organization claims this derives from Early 
Hickic elements (_er-_ "one who" + _kir_ "chest" + _gral_ "land"), though 
linguistic scholars note this construction shows misunderstandings of Early 
Hickic grammar. This internal name serves as both an identifier of true 
membership and a connection to their perceived ancestral heritage. Most modern 
Senerans, even those sympathetic to the cause, would not recognize this term.

The term "Hick" itself is embraced by the movement, transformed from a 
Kalassarian pejorative into a badge of pride in public discourse, while 
maintaining their "purer" linguistic identity within the organization - even if 
that identity isn't quite as historically accurate as they believe.

// ... rest of document continues ...
```

This revision nicely illustrates how the organization's passionate commitment to 
their heritage sometimes outpaces their actual historical knowledge - a very 
realistic trait for such a movement!

## User:


[text]  
you added a separate Etymology and Language section where a more detailed discussion of the etymology might make more sense


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):





Yes, let's reorganize to put the detailed linguistic discussion in the proper section:

```markdown:site/content/organizations/hickland-for-hicks.md
// ... after first paragraph ...

## Names and Identity

## Etymology and Language

The organization claims _Erkirgral_ derives from Early Hickic elements (_er-_ 
"one who" + _kir_ "chest" + _gral_ "land"). However, linguistic scholars note 
several issues with this construction. The agentive marker _'er_ was 
historically used as a suffix, not a prefix, and the actual Early Hickic term 
for "person" was _'al_, with _ma'al_ serving as its collective form.

This imperfect scholarship reveals much about the organization: while they 
maintain deep passion for their heritage and have acquired some knowledge of 
Early Hickic, their understanding remains incomplete. Nevertheless, they 
continue to pepper their communications with what they believe to be "pure" 
Hickic terms.

The term "Hick" itself is embraced by the movement, transformed from a 
Kalassarian pejorative into a badge of pride in public discourse, while 
maintaining their reconstructed (if not entirely accurate) linguistic identity

This organization makes more sense, with the practical usage explained first, 
followed by the more detailed linguistic analysis in its own section.

## User:


[text]  
I suppose within the organization, they call singular persons erkir. might be a good note


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):





Yes! Let me add that detail to the Etymology section:

```markdown:site/content/organizations/hickland-for-hicks.md
// ... in Etymology and Language section ...

The organization claims _Erkirgral_ derives from Early Hickic elements (_er-_ 
"one who" + _kir_ "chest" + _gral_ "land"). However, linguistic scholars note 
several issues with this construction. The agentive marker _'er_ was 
historically used as a suffix, not a prefix, and the actual Early Hickic term 
for "person" was _'al_, with _ma'al_ serving as its collective form.

Members refer to each other individually as _erkir_ (plural _erkirim_), 
reflecting their misunderstanding of Early Hickic grammar but establishing a 
consistent internal terminology. This practice has become deeply embedded in 
their organizational culture, with phrases like "true erkir" marking someone as 
a trusted member.

Early Hickic, their understanding remains incomplete. Nevertheless, they

// ... rest of document continues ...
```


This addition shows how their linguistic misconceptions have evolved into a 
functional internal jargon, which is quite realistic for such an organization!

## User:


[text]  
I dunno about erkirim. I actually have not added a number system to modern seneran, but I would think it may derive from grammar borrowed from old iutlandish (old dane) during the middle hick period, and was fully integrated by late hick


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):





Ah, good catch! Let me revise that part, removing the speculative plural form 
since we don't have that grammatical system established yet:

```markdown:site/content/organizations/hickland-for-hicks.md
// ... in Etymology and Language section ...

The revision removes the speculative plural form while leaving room for future 
development of the grammatical systems, particularly the influence of Old 
Iutlandish on Middle Hickic number marking.

## User:


[text]  
this looks good. thanks


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

You're welcome! The document now provides a good balance of organizational details and linguistic worldbuilding, while leaving appropriate space for future development of the language systems. The imperfect scholarship of the group adds an interesting layer of authenticity to their characterization as a revivalist movement.

Would you like me to make any other refinements to the document?

## User:


[text]  
I'd like to add ma'al into the early hick lexicon. this is the plurality prefix ma- and person 'al.

it would have senses of a group of people, community, tribe


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



That's a great addition to the lexicon! Let me help structure this entry:

```markdown
# ma'al
[Early Hickic]

## Etymology
Compound of _ma-_ (plurality prefix) + _'al_ ("person")

## Definitions
1. A group of people, particularly those bound by kinship or shared identity
2. A community or settlement
3. A tribe or clan unit

## Usage Notes
- Often used in contexts of social organization and collective identity
- Forms the basis for several compound terms relating to community structures
- Distinguished from simple plurals of _'al_ by implying social cohesion rather 
  than just multiple individuals

## Historical Development
The term maintained significance through Middle Hickic period, though its usage 
shifted from tribal contexts to broader community references as settlement 
patterns changed.

## Related Terms
- _'al_ (person, individual)
- _ma-_ (collective/plural prefix)
```

Would you like me to add any additional aspects to this lexicon entry?

## User:


[text]  
please format it to fit with @lexicon.md and ontolex lemon @lexicon.jsonld 


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

I'll help add `ma'al` to both the markdown lexicon and JSON-LD files. Here are the 
additions:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
// ... after 'al entry in Basic Terms section ...

- ma'al [ma.ʔal] "community, tribe" < ma-'al "COLL-person" → ma'al
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
  See: [Person Terms](#person-terms), [Social Organization](#social-organization)
  Note: Implies social cohesion rather than simple plurality
```

```jsonld:data/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.jsonld
// ... after eh:al entry ...
{
  "@id": "eh:maal",

      "lexinfo:semanticField": [
        "Person Terms",
        "Social Organization"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This adds `ma'al` as a compound of the collective prefix `ma-` and `'al` "person", 
with appropriate cross-references and semantic fields. The JSON-LD entry includes 
full ontological markup following the existing pattern.

Would you like me to add any additional senses or cross-references?

## User:

I think it should be in Person Terms instead


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Yes, you're right! Let's move it to the Person Terms section:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon

## User:


[text]  
and perhaps we add a new semantic grouping called "Political Terms"?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Yes! That's a great idea since `ma'al` bridges both person terms and political 
organization. Here's the revised entry:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Person Terms

- 'al [ʔal] "person" < Proto-Hick *ʔalu → 'al
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick))
  See: [Political Terms](#political-terms)

- ma'al [ma.ʔal] "community, tribe" < ma-'al "COLL-person" → ma'al
  ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
  See: [Political Terms](#political-terms)
  Note: Collective term implying social/political unity rather than simple plurality

### Political Terms

1. Basic Terms
   - ma'al [ma.ʔal] "community, tribe" < ma-'al "COLL-person" → ma'al
     See: [Person Terms](#person-terms)
```

```jsonld:data/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.jsonld

      "lexinfo:semanticField": [
        "Person Terms",
        "Political Terms"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This creates a new Political Terms section and properly cross-references between 
Person Terms and Political Terms. The JSON-LD entry now includes both semantic 
fields.
