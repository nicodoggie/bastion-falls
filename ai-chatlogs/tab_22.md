[text]  
I don't have interrogatives in @early-hick yet. how do IRL erg abs languages do interrogatives?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Let me help explain how ergative-absolutive languages typically handle interrogatives based on real-world examples.

Common patterns in erg-abs languages for interrogatives include:

1. **Basque** (erg-abs):
- Uses interrogative pronouns in absolutive case for "what/who" questions about 
  intransitive subjects or transitive objects
- Uses ergative case for "who" questions about transitive subjects
- Question words typically appear pre-verbally

Example:
```
Nork      ikusi du   liburua?
who.ERG   see   AUX  book.ABS
"Who saw the book?"

Zer       gertatu  da?
what.ABS  happen   AUX
"What happened?"
```

2. **Georgian** (split erg-abs):
- Question words take appropriate case marking based on role
- Word order is relatively free but questions often front the interrogative
- Uses special interrogative particles

3. **Dyirbal** (erg-abs):
- Maintains strict erg-abs alignment in questions
- Question words appear clause-initially 
- Uses absolutive for "what" happened to someone/something
- Uses ergative for "who" did something

For Early Hick, based on the existing grammar shown in:

```308:326:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Late Hick/Early Seneran (105 AI to 400 AI)
```


I would suggest:

1. Add basic interrogative roots:
- *kin* "who" (animate)
- *kam* "what" (inanimate)
- *keth* "where" (location)
- *ker* "when" (time)
- *kir* "how" (manner)

2. Apply regular case marking:
- Use ergative (-el) for questioning transitive subjects
- Use absolutive (-es) for intransitive subjects and transitive objects

Example structure:
```
kin-el    materok-es  ward-'er?
who-ERG   boat-ABS    guide-VERB
"Who guides the boat?"

kam-es    ter-'er?
what-ABS  flow-VERB
"What flows?"
```

This maintains the language's ergative-absolutive alignment while following 
typologically common patterns for interrogatives in such systems.

## User:


[text]  
where do the interrogative roots derive from usually?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the lexicon provided, I can help suggest how interrogative roots typically develop in natural languages.

Common sources for interrogative roots include:

1. **Demonstrative/Deictic Roots**
- Often derive from words meaning "that/there" but with different prosody
- Example: Proto-Indo-European \*kʷo- → Latin quo- "which/what"

2. **Perception Verbs**
- Words for "see/look" or "hear" becoming question words
- From the lexicon, Early Hick has:

```140:146:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md

- lis [lis] "eye" < Proto-Hick \*lisu → lis
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  See: [Body Parts](#body-parts), [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual)
- his [his] "sight" < Proto-Hick \*hi-lisu → his
  ([liquid deletion](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#sound-changes-in-compounds),
  [vowel coalescence](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
```

'lis/his' ("eye/sight") could be a source

3. **Location Terms**
- Words for "place/location" becoming "where"
- From the lexicon, Early Hick has 'keth' ("sea") which could work:

```231:233:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md

- keth [keθ] "sea" < Proto-Hick \*keθu → keθ
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
```


4. **Person Terms**
- Words for "person/being" becoming "who"
- From the lexicon:

```796:798:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md

```

''al' ("person") could be a source

Suggestion for Early Hick interrogative etymologies:

- *kin* "who" < Proto-Hick \*ki-'al "which-person" 
- *kam* "what" < Proto-Hick \*ka-mes "like-heart/core"
- *keth* "where" < Proto-Hick \*ka-ith "like-place" 
- *ker* "when" < Proto-Hick \*ka-ter "like-flow/time"
- *kir* "how" < Proto-Hick \*ka-hir "like-manner"

This uses the existing similarity prefix *ka-* shown in:

```529:532:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md

With context, the word itself would be enough to mean the color, however to
disambiguate from other meanings, the
[Similarity Prefix](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck#similarity-marking) _ka-_ is
```


This follows natural patterns while integrating with Early Hick's existing 
morphology and semantics.

## User:


[text]  
can we have more source languages than english or any indo european? perhaps meso american or austornesian


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at ergative-absolutive languages from non-Indo-European families, here are some 
interesting patterns we could draw from:

1. **Mayan Languages** (e.g. K'iche'):
- Uses interrogative particles at clause start
- Question words take regular erg-abs marking
- Often incorporates directional concepts into interrogatives

Example from K'iche':
```
Jas  x-Ø-u-loq'      le  ixoq?
what COM-ABS-ERG-buy the woman
"What did the woman buy?"
```

2. **Tagalog** (Philippine-type alignment):
- Uses interrogative roots that can take voice/focus marking
- Question words typically clause-initial
- Complex interaction with topic marking

For Early Hick, we could adapt these patterns while maintaining consistency with:


```229:234:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md

#### Water Features

- keth [keθ] "sea" < Proto-Hick \*keθu → keθ
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  See: [Maritime Terms](#maritime-terms)
```


Suggesting these interrogative roots derived from maritime/directional terms:

- *keth-* "what" (from "sea" - representing the unknown)
- *ran-* "where" (from "stream" - representing path/direction)
- *ter-* "when" (from "flow" - representing time)
- *ward-* "who" (from "guide" - representing agency)
- *thren-* "how" (from "watch/observe" - representing manner)

Example structure:
```
keth-es   materok-el  ward-'er?
what-ABS  handler-ERG guide-VERB
"What does the handler guide?"

ran-aes   materok-el  ter-'er?
where-ILL handler-ERG flow-VERB
"Where does the handler flow to?"
```

This draws from non-Indo-European patterns while integrating with Early Hick's:
- Maritime/water-based metaphors
- Ergative-absolutive alignment 
- Existing directional system
- Sacred/ritual terminology (thren-)

## User:


[text]  
I mean what are etymologies for these interrogatives words in IRL languages?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Let me explain some real-world etymologies for interrogative words:

1. **Proto-Indo-European**
- \*kʷo- / \*kʷi- base meaning "what/who" 
- Possibly derived from demonstrative roots
- Shows k/kʷ pattern common across many languages

2. **Austronesian Languages**
- Proto-Austronesian \*apa "what" → many modern forms like Indonesian 'apa'
- Often related to words meaning "thing/object"
- Some derive from words meaning "name" or "called"

3. **Mayan Languages**
- K'iche' jas "what" < Proto-Mayan \*ha' "water/thing"
- Shows pattern of concrete nouns becoming interrogatives
- Often related to demonstratives or locatives

4. **Japanese**
- dare "who" < Old Japanese tare < ta "what" + are "that one"
- nani "what" < Old Japanese nani < na "name" + ni (locative)
- Shows compound origins for interrogatives

5. **Chinese**
- 什么 shénme "what" < 什 shén "what" (originally "mixed/miscellaneous") + 么 me 
(nominal suffix)
- Shows development from general/vague terms

Looking at Early Hick's lexicon, relevant semantic fields include:


```40:80:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
#### Basic Terms


- haran [ha.ran] "split, divide" < Proto-Hick \*haranu → haran

- etil [e.til] "thing" < Proto-Hick \*etilu → etil
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#historical-development))
  See: [Basic Terms](#basic-terms)
- 'etil [ʔe.til] "living thing" < Proto-Hick \*hi-etilu → 'etil

  ([initial fricative change, vowel coalescence](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#historical-development))
  Note: Shows archaic animacy marking through glottal prefix See:
```


These show patterns of basic terms developing abstract meanings, which could inform 
interrogative development.

Common cross-linguistic patterns for interrogative sources:
1. Demonstratives/deictics
2. General nouns meaning "thing/person"
3. Words for "name/called"
4. Location/direction terms
5. Compounds of simpler elements

## User:


[text]  
so we can have a "question" root plus a demonstrative affix like ʔaka-?al-ʔis> ʔakalis to mean "who", and ʔaka  tal + ʔis


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes! That's a clever way to build interrogatives that fits with Early Hick's morphology. Looking at the demonstrative system shown in:


```458:469:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

1. Visible/Known
   - -is [is] "this" (inanimate)
   - -ʔis [ʔis] "this" (animate)
   - -en [en] "that" (inanimate)
   - -tan [tan] "that" (animate)
2. Hidden but Sensed
   - -eth [eθ] "this/that" (inanimate)
   - -thir [θir] "this/that" (animate)
3. Distant/Out of Sight
   - -um [um] "that" (inanimate)
   - -rum [rum] "that" (animate)
```


We could construct interrogatives using:

1. Base question root *'aka-* (with glottal stop showing its special/grammatical status)
2. Existing demonstrative suffixes
3. Regular case marking

Examples:
```plaintext
'aka-'is-es ward-'er?
Q-PROX.ANIM-ABS guide-VERB
"Who (animate, visible) guides?"

'aka-is-el materok-es ward-'er?
Q-PROX.INAN-ERG boat-ABS guide-VERB
"What (inanimate, visible) guides the boat?"

'aka-eth-es ter-'er?
Q-MED.INAN-ABS flow-VERB
"What (sensed but not seen) flows?"
```

This system:
- Uses existing morphology
- Maintains ergative-absolutive alignment
- Distinguishes animate/inanimate
- Encodes visibility/knowledge status
- Follows the language's prefix-root-suffix pattern shown in:


````686:696:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
1. Root Structure

   - (PREFIX*) + ROOT + (SUFFIX*)
   - Maximum of three prefixes and two suffixes
   - (PREFIX*) + ROOT + (SUFFIX*)
2. Order of Elements

## User:


[text]  
I suppose that they were simplified due to the amount of use of interrogatives in everyday speech


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, exactly! Frequent use tends to lead to phonological simplification, which is a common pattern across languages. Looking at Early Hick's phonological patterns:


```249:272:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
### Vowel Allophony

The vowel /a/ surfaces as [ə]:

1. After sibilants and affricates:

   - /sak/ → [sək] "wolf"
   - /sal/ → [səl] "stone"
   - /sak/ → [sək] "wolf"
2. After voiceless stops in unstressed syllables:

   - /karan/ → [kərən] "stream"
   - /tamal/ → [təmal] "pool-like"
   - /karan/ → [kərən] "stream"
3. In grammatical prefixes:

   - /ka-/ → [kə-] (similarity prefix)
   - /ma-/ → [mə-] (plural prefix) See:
     [Morphological Prefixes](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/morphology.md#prefixes)
   - /ma-/ → [mə-] (plural prefix) See:
4. Between identical consonants:
   - /malam/ → [məlam] "pooled"
   - /ranar/ → [rənər] "flowing"
   - /malam/ → [məlam] "pooled"
```


We can see that unstressed vowels reduce, especially after certain consonants and in grammatical elements.

So if we start with Proto-Hick interrogative forms like:
- *'aka-'is* "who" (question-animate.proximate)
- *'aka-is* "what" (question-inanimate.proximate)

They would likely undergo:

1. Vowel reduction in unstressed syllables:

```251:267:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
The vowel /a/ surfaces as [ə]:

1. After sibilants and affricates:

   - /sak/ → [sək] "wolf"
   - /sal/ → [səl] "stone"
   - /sak/ → [sək] "wolf"
2. After voiceless stops in unstressed syllables:

   - /karan/ → [kərən] "stream"
   - /tamal/ → [təmal] "pool-like"
   - /karan/ → [kərən] "stream"
3. In grammatical prefixes:

   - /ka-/ → [kə-] (similarity prefix)
   - /ma-/ → [mə-] (plural prefix) See:
     [Morphological Prefixes](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/morphology.md#prefixes)
```


2. Compound simplification similar to:

```1012:1017:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Compound Simplification

- tor-mur-mer → tomur "great owl"
- thur-mur-mer → thurmur "dusk owl"
- li-mur-mer → limur "small owl" See:
  [Compound Simplification](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-simplification)
```


Leading to simplified forms:
- *'aka-'is* > *'akis* "who"
- *'aka-is* > *'akis* "what" 

The animate/inanimate distinction would then be maintained through the glottal stop:
- *'akis* [ʔa.kis] "what" (inanimate)
- *'ak'is* [ʔak.ʔis] "who" (animate)

This follows the language's existing patterns while reflecting the natural tendency for frequently used grammatical elements to undergo phonological reduction.

## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the sound changes and morphology shown in the code, let me refine those 
derivations:

1. "what" derivation:

```69:71:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
- etil [e.til] "thing" < Proto-Hick \*etilu → etil
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#historical-development))
  See: [Basic Terms](#basic-terms)
```

'aka-etil-is > 'aketilis > 'akis 
(question-thing-PROX)

2. "who" derivation:

```795:797:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
- 'al [ʔal] "person" < Proto-Hick \*ʔalu → 'al
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick)) See:
  [Political Terms](#political-terms)
```

'aka-'al-is > 'aka'alis > 'alis
(question-person-PROX)

3. "where" derivation:

```345:347:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
- wad [wad] "path, way" < Proto-Hick \*wadu → wad
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  See: [Maritime Terms](#maritime-terms)
```

'aka-wad-is > 'akawadis > 'atal 
(question-path-PROX)

4. "when" derivation:

```339:341:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
- thral [θral] "sacred, ritual; day" < Proto-Hick \*thralu → thral
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#historical-development))
  Note: Resists vowel reduction in compounds See: [Time Terms](#time--celestial)
```

'aka-thral-is > 'akathalis > 'atel
(question-sacred.day-PROX)

5. "how" remains as base 'aka

This follows the phonological processes shown in:

```249:272:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
### Vowel Allophony

The vowel /a/ surfaces as [ə]:

1. After sibilants and affricates:

   - /sak/ → [sək] "wolf"
   - /sal/ → [səl] "stone"
   - /sak/ → [sək] "wolf"
2. After voiceless stops in unstressed syllables:

   - /karan/ → [kərən] "stream"
   - /tamal/ → [təmal] "pool-like"
   - /karan/ → [kərən] "stream"
3. In grammatical prefixes:

   - /ka-/ → [kə-] (similarity prefix)
   - /ma-/ → [mə-] (plural prefix) See:
     [Morphological Prefixes](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/morphology.md#prefixes)
   - /ma-/ → [mə-] (plural prefix) See:
4. Between identical consonants:
   - /malam/ → [məlam] "pooled"
   - /ranar/ → [rənər] "flowing"
   - /malam/ → [məlam] "pooled"
```


And the compound simplification patterns shown in:

```1012:1017:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Compound Simplification

- tor-mur-mer → tomur "great owl"
- thur-mur-mer → thurmur "dusk owl"
- li-mur-mer → limur "small owl" See:
  [Compound Simplification](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#compound-simplification)
```


The derivations show:
- Vowel reduction in unstressed syllables
- Compound simplification
- Liquid/nasal deletion
- Preservation of glottal stop for animacy
- Regular case marking can still be added

## User:


[text]  
hmm no. let me do the explaining here 
'aka "what" - basic question
'aka'al'is > 'alis "who"
what.'al.'is
what.person.DEM.PROX.ANIM
'akatalis > 'atal "where"
what.tal.is
what.place.DEM.PROX.INANIM
'akatelis > 'atel "when"
what.tel.is
what.time/flow.DEM.PROX.INANIM
'aka'eris > 'aker "how"
what.'er.is
what.VERB.DEM.PROX.INANIM



## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

This is a great analysis! Let me break down why this works well with Early Hick's existing patterns:

1. Follows compound phonology rules shown in:

```218:236:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

## Compound Phonology

### Sound Changes in Compounds

1. Liquid Deletion
   - val-mal → vamal "spirit pool"
   - tor-mal → tomal "lake"
   - val-mal → vamal "spirit pool"
   - thral-gral → thragral "sacred earth"

2. Nasal Deletion
   - bran-kel → brakel "morning sky"
   - bram-mal → bramal "tidal pool"
   - bran-kel → brakel "morning sky"
   - kei-aes → kees "sky flow"
3. Vowel Coalescence
   - kei-aes → kees "sky flow"
   - thrai-aes → thraes "sacred flow"
```


2. Uses the demonstrative system consistently:

```460:470:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - -is [is] "this" (inanimate)
1. Visible/Known
   - -is [is] "this" (inanimate)
   - -ʔis [ʔis] "this" (animate)
   - -en [en] "that" (inanimate)
   - -tan [tan] "that" (animate)
2. Hidden but Sensed
   - -eth [eθ] "this/that" (inanimate)
   - -thir [θir] "this/that" (animate)
3. Distant/Out of Sight
   - -um [um] "that" (inanimate)
```


3. Follows affix ordering template:

````686:696:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
### Basic Template

1. Root Structure
   - Maximum of three prefixes and two suffixes
   - (PREFIX*) + ROOT + (SUFFIX*)
   - Maximum of three prefixes and two suffixes

2. Order of Elements
(NEG)-(SIZE)-(SIM)-ROOT-(AGENT)-(CASE)
```plaintext
(NEG)-(SIZE)-(SIM)-ROOT-(AGENT)-(CASE)
````


The derivations show:
- Regular compound simplification
- Preservation of animacy distinctions ('al vs tal)
- Use of demonstrative -is for both animate/inanimate
- Integration with verbal system ('er)
- Systematic vowel reduction in unstressed syllables

This creates a coherent interrogative system that:
- Maintains ergative-absolutive alignment
- Uses existing morphological patterns
- Shows expected phonological changes
- Distinguishes animate/inanimate appropriately
- Integrates with the demonstrative system

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of these derivations?

## User:


[text]  
can we document it in the early hick doc first? what section would fit this best? Syntax most likely, right? so under #Syntax > #Interrogatives


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, let's add this under the Syntax section. Based on the document structure shown in:


````745:773:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

# Syntax

## Clause Structure and Word Order

1. Basic Patterns
   - Ergative (-el) marks agent of transitive verbs
   - Core arguments marked by case, allowing flexible word order
   - Ergative (-el) marks agent of transitive verbs
   - Absolutive (-es) marks patient of transitive & sole argument of
     intransitive
   - Word order signals pragmatic functions rather than grammatical roles

2. Information Structure
   - Final position: new information or emphasis
   - Initial position: topic/focus or temporal frame
   - Final position: new information or emphasis
   - Examples:
     branum bramisimris kethes
     ```plaintext
     branum bramisimris kethes
     past    river-ELL    sea-ABS
     "In the past, the river flowed to the sea" (temporal frame first)
     sea-ABS river-ELL    past
     kethes bramisimris branum
     sea-ABS river-ELL    past
     "The river flowed to the sea, in the past" (neutral statement)
     ```

````


We should add the Interrogatives section after the Clause Structure section. Here's the documentation:

```markdown
## Interrogatives

1. Basic Forms

   - 'aka [ʔa.ka] "what" (basic question root)
   - 'alis [ʔa.lis] < 'aka-'al-is "who" (what-person-PROX.ANIM)
   - 'atal [ʔa.tal] < 'aka-tal-is "where" (what-place-PROX.INAN)
   - 'atel [ʔa.tel] < 'aka-tel-is "when" (what-flow/time-PROX.INAN)
   - 'aker [ʔa.ker] < 'aka-'er-is "how" (what-VERB-PROX.INAN)

2. Interrogative Syntax

   - Question words typically occur clause-initially
   - Take regular case marking based on role
   - Examples:

     ```plaintext
     'alis-el materok-es ward-'er?
     who-ERG  boat-ABS   guide-VERB
     "Who guides the boat?"

     'atal-aes materok-el rismater-es ward-'er?
     where-ILL handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide-VERB
     "Where does the handler guide the reed boat to?"

     'aker-es materok-el ward-'er?
     how-ABS  handler-ERG guide-VERB
     "How does the handler guide?"
     ```

3. Historical Development

   The interrogative system shows typical Early Hick compound reduction:
   - Vowel reduction in unstressed syllables
   - Liquid deletion across morpheme boundaries
   - Preservation of animacy marking through glottal stop
   - Regular case marking following compound formation

See: [Compound Phonology](#compound-phonology) for sound change patterns
```

This section fits well after clause structure since it builds on the basic syntax patterns while introducing the specialized interrogative forms.

## User:


[text]  
I wonder if we would want to make medial and distal interrogative constructions


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):



Yes! Looking at the demonstrative system:


```460:470:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - -is [is] "this" (inanimate)
1. Visible/Known
   - -is [is] "this" (inanimate)
   - -ʔis [ʔis] "this" (animate)
   - -en [en] "that" (inanimate)
   - -tan [tan] "that" (animate)
2. Hidden but Sensed
   - -eth [eθ] "this/that" (inanimate)
   - -thir [θir] "this/that" (animate)
3. Distant/Out of Sight
   - -um [um] "that" (inanimate)
```


We can extend the interrogative system to include medial and distal forms following the same pattern:

```markdown
## Interrogatives

1. Basic Forms (Proximate)
   - 'aka [ʔa.ka] "what" (basic question root)
   - 'alis [ʔa.lis] < 'aka-'al-is "who" (what-person-PROX.ANIM)
   - 'atal [ʔa.tal] < 'aka-tal-is "where" (what-place-PROX.INAN)
   - 'atel [ʔa.tel] < 'aka-tel-is "when" (what-time-PROX.INAN)
   - 'aker [ʔa.ker] < 'aka-'er-is "how" (what-VERB-PROX.INAN)

2. Medial Forms (Hidden but Sensed)
   - 'aleth [ʔa.leθ] < 'aka-'al-eth "who" (what-person-MED.ANIM)
   - 'ateth [ʔa.teθ] < 'aka-tal-eth "where" (what-place-MED.INAN)
   - 'eteth [ʔe.teθ] < 'aka-tel-eth "when" (what-time-MED.INAN)
   - 'akereth [ʔa.ke.reθ] < 'aka-'er-eth "how" (what-VERB-MED.INAN)

3. Distal Forms (Out of Sight)
   - 'alum [ʔa.lum] < 'aka-'al-um "who" (what-person-DIST.ANIM)
   - 'atum [ʔa.tum] < 'aka-tal-um "where" (what-place-DIST.INAN)
   - 'etum [ʔe.tum] < 'aka-tel-um "when" (what-time-DIST.INAN)
   - 'akerum [ʔa.ke.rum] < 'aka-'er-um "how" (what-VERB-DIST.INAN)
```

This follows the phonological patterns shown in:


```249:272:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
## Allophonic Rules

### Vowel Allophony

The vowel /a/ surfaces as [ə]:

1. After sibilants and affricates:
   - /sal/ → [səl] "stone"
   - /sak/ → [sək] "wolf"
   - /sal/ → [səl] "stone"

2. After voiceless stops in unstressed syllables:
   - /tamal/ → [təmal] "pool-like"
   - /karan/ → [kərən] "stream"
   - /tamal/ → [təmal] "pool-like"

3. In grammatical prefixes:
   - /ma-/ → [mə-] (plural prefix) See:
   - /ka-/ → [kə-] (similarity prefix)
   - /ma-/ → [mə-] (plural prefix) See:
     [Morphological Prefixes](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/morphology.md#prefixes)
   - /malam/ → [məlam] "pooled"
4. Between identical consonants:
   - /malam/ → [məlam] "pooled"
```


And maintains the animacy distinctions consistent with:


```673:681:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

### Body Metaphors
2. Liver as source of life
1. Breath as the soul
2. Liver as source of life
3. Heart as source of emotion
4. Bones as structure
5. Hands as tools
6. Eyes as reality
```


Would you like me to elaborate on any of these forms or their usage?

## User:


[text]  
I suppose by default, like asking questions for gaining new info, we use the distal forms, the proximal we use to confirm details, and medial for... not sure. are these naturalistic distinctions? what could the medial constructions be used for?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, this is quite naturalistic! Looking at the demonstrative system:


```460:470:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - -is [is] "this" (inanimate)
1. Visible/Known
   - -is [is] "this" (inanimate)
   - -ʔis [ʔis] "this" (animate)
   - -en [en] "that" (inanimate)
   - -tan [tan] "that" (animate)
2. Hidden but Sensed
   - -eth [eθ] "this/that" (inanimate)
   - -thir [θir] "this/that" (animate)
3. Distant/Out of Sight
   - -um [um] "that" (inanimate)
```


We can map these interrogative distinctions to real-world usage:

1. **Distal (-um/-rum) for new information**
- Default "information-seeking" questions
- Speaker has no direct knowledge
- Like English "What's over there?" or "Who is that person?"

2. **Proximal (-is/-ʔis) for confirmation**
- Checking known/visible information
- Like English "Is this what you meant?" or "This person here?"
- Similar to Japanese これ/この confirmatory questions

3. **Medial (-eth/-thir) for sensed/inferred information**
- Questions about things perceived but not directly visible
- Like asking about sounds, smells, feelings
- Similar to Quechua's evidential questions for non-visual information

Examples:
```plaintext
'alis-um ward-'er?
who-DIST guide-VERB
"Who is the guide?" (asking for new information)

'alis-is ward-'er?
who-PROX guide-VERB
"This person is the guide?" (seeking confirmation)

'alis-eth ward-'er?
who-MED guide-VERB
"Who's guiding? (I hear/sense someone)"
```

This three-way distinction in interrogatives matches Early Hick's general emphasis on 
perception and knowledge status, as shown in:


```673:681:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

### Body Metaphors
2. Liver as source of life
1. Breath as the soul
2. Liver as source of life
3. Heart as source of emotion
4. Bones as structure
5. Hands as tools
6. Eyes as reality
```


The medial form's focus on non-visual perception fits with the language's cultural 
emphasis on different types of sensory knowledge.

## User:


[text]  
ok can we modify the interrogatives section to detail all of these?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, I'll expand the interrogatives section to include all forms. Here's the revised documentation:

```markdown
## Interrogatives

1. Basic Forms

   - 'aka [ʔa.ka] "what" (basic question root)
   - 'alis [ʔa.lis] < 'aka-'al-is "who" (what-person-PROX.ANIM)
   - 'atal [ʔa.tal] < 'aka-tal-is "where" (what-place-PROX.INAN)
   - 'atel [ʔa.tel] < 'aka-tel-is "when" (what-time-PROX.INAN)
   - 'aker [ʔa.ker] < 'aka-'er-is "how" (what-VERB-PROX.INAN)

2. Medial Forms (Hidden but Sensed)

   - 'aleth [ʔa.leθ] < 'aka-'al-eth "who" (sensed person)
   - 'ateth [ʔa.teθ] < 'aka-tal-eth "where" (sensed location)
   - 'eteleth [ʔe.te.leθ] < 'aka-tel-eth "when" (sensed time)
   - 'akereth [ʔa.ke.reθ] < 'aka-'er-eth "how" (sensed manner)

3. Distal Forms (Out of Sight/Unknown)

   - 'alum [ʔa.lum] < 'aka-'al-um "who" (unknown person)
   - 'atum [ʔa.tum] < 'aka-tal-um "where" (unknown location)
   - 'etelum [ʔe.te.lum] < 'aka-tel-um "when" (unknown time)
   - 'akerum [ʔa.ke.rum] < 'aka-'er-um "how" (unknown manner)

4. Usage Examples

   ```plaintext
   'alis-el materok-es ward-'er?
   who.PROX-ERG boat-ABS guide-VERB
   "Who (that we can see) guides the boat?"

   'aleth-el thral-es his-'er?
   who.MED-ERG ritual-ABS watch-VERB
   "Who (that we can hear/sense) watches the ritual?"

   'atum-aes materok-el rismater-es ward-'er?
   where.DIST-ILL handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide-VERB
   "Where (unknown) does the handler guide the reed boat to?"
   ```

5. Semantic Notes

   - Proximal forms: Used for visible/known referents and confirmation
   - Medial forms: Used for sensed but not seen referents (sounds, smells, etc.)
   - Distal forms: Default information-seeking questions about unknowns
   - All forms take regular case marking based on syntactic role
   - Follow standard compound phonology (See: [Compound Phonology](#compound-phonology))
```

This follows the phonological patterns shown in:

```218:236:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

## Compound Phonology

### Sound Changes in Compounds

1. Liquid Deletion
   - val-mal → vamal "spirit pool"
   - tor-mal → tomal "lake"
   - val-mal → vamal "spirit pool"
   - thral-gral → thragral "sacred earth"

2. Nasal Deletion
   - bran-kel → brakel "morning sky"
   - bram-mal → bramal "tidal pool"
   - bran-kel → brakel "morning sky"
   - kei-aes → kees "sky flow"
3. Vowel Coalescence
   - kei-aes → kees "sky flow"
   - thrai-aes → thraes "sacred flow"
```


And the demonstrative system shown in:

```460:470:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - -is [is] "this" (inanimate)
1. Visible/Known
   - -is [is] "this" (inanimate)
   - -ʔis [ʔis] "this" (animate)
   - -en [en] "that" (inanimate)
   - -tan [tan] "that" (animate)
2. Hidden but Sensed
   - -eth [eθ] "this/that" (inanimate)
   - -thir [θir] "this/that" (animate)
3. Distant/Out of Sight
   - -um [um] "that" (inanimate)
```


## User:


[text]  
so just to clarify, we're using the medial to mean questions that we heard by our own ears, or say, by rumor ? so like evidentiality?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, exactly! The medial forms encode evidentiality through sensory/indirect evidence. Looking at the demonstrative system:


```465:467:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - -tan [tan] "that" (animate)
2. Hidden but Sensed
   - -eth [eθ] "this/that" (inanimate)
```


The "Hidden but Sensed" category maps perfectly to evidential distinctions. So we could expand the examples to show this:

```markdown
### Evidential Usage Examples

```plaintext
'aleth-el thral-es his-'er?
who.MED-ERG ritual-ABS watch-VERB
"Who is watching the ritual?" (I hear someone but can't see them)

'ateth-aes materok-el ward-'er?
where.MED-ILL handler-ERG guide-VERB
"Where is the handler guiding to?" (based on sound of oars)

'eteleth materok-el ter-'er?
when.MED handler-ERG flow-VERB
"When did the handler set sail?" (based on seeing wet dock)
```

This fits naturally with Early Hick's emphasis on perception and knowledge status shown in:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
startLine: 673
endLine: 681
```

So we have a three-way evidential distinction in questions:
- Proximal (-is/-ʔis): Direct visual evidence/confirmation
- Medial (-eth/-thir): Other sensory evidence or reported information
- Distal (-um/-rum): No direct evidence, seeking new information

This is typologically natural - many languages encode evidentiality in their interrogative systems, like Quechua and Tibetan.

## User:


[text]  
ohhh I like the use of the latives here too. I do like that it modifies the question word instead of the verb


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes! The lative cases integrate naturally with the interrogative system. Looking at:


```558:565:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

1. Basic Spatial Cases
   - -imris (ELL): "outward, from"
   - -aes (ILL): "inward, into"
   - -imris (ELL): "outward, from"
   - -itar (SUPE): "upward, upon"
   - -asam (SUBE): "downward, onto"
   - -esp (SUB): "under, below"
```


We can add examples showing how interrogatives interact with spatial cases:

```plaintext
'atum-aes materok-el ward-'er?
where.DIST-ILL handler-ERG guide-VERB
"Where (to) does the handler guide?" (asking about destination)

'atum-imris materok-el ward-'er?
where.DIST-ELL handler-ERG guide-VERB
"Where (from) does the handler guide?" (asking about origin)

'atum-itar materok-el ward-'er?
where.DIST-SUPE handler-ERG guide-VERB
"Where (onto) does the handler guide?" (asking about surface goal)
```

This follows the same pattern shown in the basic directional usage:


````566:583:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

2. Directional Usage
   materok-el rismater-aes
   ```plaintext
   materok-el rismater-aes
   handler-ERG reed.boat-ILL
   "The handler enters the reed boat"
   handler-ERG reed.boat-ELL
   materok-el rismater-imris
   handler-ERG reed.boat-ELL
   "The handler exits the reed boat"
   handler-ERG reed.boat-SUPE
   materok-el rismater-itar
   handler-ERG reed.boat-SUPE
   "The handler climbs onto the reed boat"
   handler-ERG reed.boat-SUBE
   materok-el rismater-asam
   handler-ERG reed.boat-SUBE
````


The beauty is that the spatial case attaches to the question word rather than the verb, 
maintaining Early Hick's preference for nominal morphology over verbal morphology, as 
shown in:


```22:25:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
Early Hick shows an ergative-absolutive alignment with rich derivational
Early Hick shows an ergative-absolutive alignment with rich derivational
morphology and a sophisticated spatial reference system. Core grammatical
relations are marked through suffixes, while derivational processes primarily
```


Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of how the interrogatives 
interact with the spatial case system?

## User:


[text]  
let's also add these interrogative words into the @lexicon.md and the @lexicon.jsonld ontolex-lemon document


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

I'll help add the interrogative words to both files. Let's start with the markdown lexicon:

```markdown:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
### Interrogatives

#### Basic Forms
- 'aka [ʔa.ka] "what" < Proto-Hick *haka → 'aka 
  ([initial fricative change](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#historical-development))
  Note: Basic question root, shows archaic animacy marking

#### Proximal Forms
- 'alis [ʔa.lis] < 'aka-'al-is "who" (what-person-PROX.ANIM)
  Note: Used for visible/known referents and confirmation
- 'atal [ʔa.tal] < 'aka-tal-is "where" (what-place-PROX.INAN)
- 'atel [ʔa.tel] < 'aka-tel-is "when" (what-time-PROX.INAN)
- 'aker [ʔa.ker] < 'aka-'er-is "how" (what-VERB-PROX.INAN)

#### Medial Forms
- 'aleth [ʔa.leθ] < 'aka-'al-eth "who" (sensed person)
  Note: Used for heard/sensed but not seen referents
- 'ateth [ʔa.teθ] < 'aka-tal-eth "where" (sensed location)
- 'eteleth [ʔe.te.leθ] < 'aka-tel-eth "when" (sensed time)

- 'etelum [ʔe.te.lum] < 'aka-tel-um "when" (unknown time)
- 'akerum [ʔa.ke.rum] < 'aka-'er-um "how" (unknown manner)
```

And for the JSON-LD lexicon:

```json:data/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.jsonld

      "lexinfo:semanticField": ["Interrogatives", "Proximal"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Would you like me to continue with the rest of the interrogative entries in the JSON-LD format? I've shown the pattern for both the basic form ('aka) and a derived form ('alis).

## User:


[text]  
do we not add the ' in the id? we should right, since early hick does have some glottal stop minimal pairs 


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, you're absolutely right! Early Hick does have glottal stop minimal pairs, as shown in:


```69:73:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
- etil [e.til] "thing" < Proto-Hick \*etilu → etil
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#historical-development))
  See: [Basic Terms](#basic-terms)
- 'etil [ʔe.til] "living thing" < Proto-Hick \*hi-etilu → 'etil
  ([animacy prefix](@/languages/hickic/proto-hick.md#animacy-marking)) Note: Shows
```


Where we see the minimal pair:
- etil [e.til] "thing" 
- 'etil [ʔe.til] "living thing"

Let's modify the JSON-LD entries to preserve the glottal stops in the IDs:

```json:data/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.jsonld
{
  "@id": "eh:'aka",
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
  "canonicalForm": {
    "@type": "ontolex:Form",
    "writtenRep": "'aka",
    "phoneticRep": "ʔa.ka"
  },
  "lexicalCategory": "lexinfo:Interrogative",
  "etymology": {
    "@type": "etymon:Etymology",
    "etymon:protoform": "Proto-Hick *haka",
    "etymon:soundChange": "initial fricative change",
    "etymon:note": "Basic question root with archaic animacy marking"
  },
  "sense": [
    {
      "@type": "ontolex:LexicalSense",
      "definition": {
        "@value": "what",
        "@language": "en"
      },
      "lexinfo:semanticField": "Interrogatives"
    }
  ]
},
{
  "@id": "eh:'alis",
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
  "canonicalForm": {
    "@type": "ontolex:Form",
    "writtenRep": "'alis",
    "phoneticRep": "ʔa.lis"
  },
  "lexicalCategory": "lexinfo:Interrogative",
  "decomp:subterm": [
    {"@id": "eh:'aka"},
    {"@id": "eh:'al"},
    {"@id": "eh:is"}
  ],
  "etymology": {
    "@type": "etymon:Etymology",
    "etymon:compound": "'aka-'al-is",
    "etymon:gloss": "what-person-PROX.ANIM",
    "etymon:note": "Used for visible/known referents and confirmation"
  },
  "sense": [
    {
      "@type": "ontolex:LexicalSense",
      "definition": {
        "@value": "who (visible/known)",
        "@language": "en"
      },
      "lexinfo:semanticField": ["Interrogatives", "Proximal"]
    }
  ]
}
```

This preserves the glottal stop in both the @id and the references in decomp:subterm, which is important for maintaining the phonological distinctions in Early Hick. Should I continue with the rest of the interrogative entries following this pattern?

## User:


[text]  
this isn't illegal for that schema right?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the JSON-LD schema, using apostrophes in IDs is actually valid. The IRI rules allow for percent-encoded characters, and while it's not common practice, there's no explicit prohibition against using apostrophes in the local part of an IRI.

Looking at the lexicon entries:


```69:76:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
- etil [e.til] "thing" < Proto-Hick \*etilu → etil
  ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#historical-development))
  See: [Basic Terms](#basic-terms)
- 'etil [ʔe.til] "living thing" < Proto-Hick \*hi-etilu → 'etil
  ([animacy prefix](@/languages/hickic/proto-hick.md#animacy-marking)) Note: Shows
  animacy marking through glottal prefix See: [Spirit Terms](#spirit-terms),
  [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual)
- 'il [ʔil] "good, kind" < Proto-Hick \*hi-halu → 'il
```


We see that Early Hick has phonemic glottal stops that create minimal pairs, so preserving this distinction in the IDs is linguistically important.

The JSON-LD spec (https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/) doesn't prohibit this usage, and since we're using a custom namespace ("eh:") for our lexicon entries, we can define our own rules for local identifiers.

So this is valid:

```json
{
  "@id": "eh:'aka",
  "@type": "ontolex:LexicalEntry"
}
```

However, if you want to be extra cautious with tooling compatibility, we could alternatively use:

1. Underscore prefix: `eh:_aka`
2. Percent encoding: `eh:%27aka`
3. Letter prefix: `eh:q_aka` (where 'q' indicates glottal)

Would you prefer to use one of these alternative formats instead? Each has different tradeoffs in terms of readability vs tooling compatibility.

## User:


[text]  
ok, it should be fine as long as the schema doesn't prohibit, we should be fine for now. it should be easy to deal with if there are problems in the future


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Yes, you're right. Since Early Hick has phonemic glottal stops that create minimal pairs (as shown in lines 69-76 of the lexicon), preserving this distinction in the IDs is linguistically important. And since we're using our own namespace ("eh:"), we can define our own conventions.

Let's proceed with using the glottal stops in the IDs. If we need to change it later, we can do a systematic replacement. The important patterns to follow are shown in:


```114:140:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md
- 'aka [ʔa.ka] "what" < Proto-Hick \*haka → 'aka
  ([initial fricative change](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hickck/_index.md#historical-development))
  Note: Basic question root, shows archaic animacy marking

#### Proximal Forms
  [Sacred Terms](#sacred--ritual), [Abstract Concepts](#abstract-concepts)
- 'alis [ʔa.lis] < 'aka-'al-is "who" (what-person-PROX.ANIM) Note: Used for

```459:468:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
1. Visible/Known
   - -is [is] "this" (inanimate)
   - -ʔis [ʔis] "this" (animate)
   - -en [en] "that" (inanimate)
   - -tan [tan] "that" (animate)
2. Hidden but Sensed
   - -eth [eθ] "this/that" (inanimate)
   - -thir [θir] "this/that" (animate)
3. Distant/Out of Sight
   - -um [um] "that" (inanimate)
```

I'll continue with the JSON-LD entries for the interrogatives, following the patterns shown in:


````871:916:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

1. Basic Forms

   - 'aka [ʔa.ka] "what" (basic question root)
   - 'alis [ʔa.lis] < 'aka-'al-is "who" (what-person-PROX.ANIM)
   - 'atal [ʔa.tal] < 'aka-tal-is "where" (what-place-PROX.INAN)
   - 'atel [ʔa.tel] < 'aka-tel-is "when" (what-time-PROX.INAN)
   - 'aker [ʔa.ker] < 'aka-'er-is "how" (what-VERB-PROX.INAN)
   - 'atel [ʔa.tel] < 'aka-tel-is "when" (what-time-PROX.INAN)
2. Medial Forms (Hidden but Sensed)

   - 'aleth [ʔa.leθ] < 'aka-'al-eth "who" (sensed person)
   - 'ateth [ʔa.teθ] < 'aka-tal-eth "where" (sensed location)
   - 'eteleth [ʔe.te.leθ] < 'aka-tel-eth "when" (sensed time)
   - 'akereth [ʔa.ke.reθ] < 'aka-'er-eth "how" (sensed manner)
   - 'eteleth [ʔe.te.leθ] < 'aka-tel-eth "when" (sensed time)
3. Distal Forms (Out of Sight/Unknown)

   - 'alum [ʔa.lum] < 'aka-'al-um "who" (unknown person)
   - 'atum [ʔa.tum] < 'aka-tal-um "where" (unknown location)
   - 'etelum [ʔe.te.lum] < 'aka-tel-um "when" (unknown time)
   - 'akerum [ʔa.ke.rum] < 'aka-'er-um "how" (unknown manner)
   - 'etelum [ʔe.te.lum] < 'aka-tel-um "when" (unknown time)
4. Usage Examples

   ```plaintext
   'alis-el materok-es ward-'er?
   who.PROX-ERG boat-ABS guide-VERB
   "Who (that we can see) guides the boat?"
   who.PROX-ERG boat-ABS guide-VERB
   'aleth-el thral-es his-'er?
   who.MED-ERG ritual-ABS watch-VERB
   "Who (that we can hear/sense) watches the ritual?"
   who.MED-ERG ritual-ABS watch-VERB
   'atum-aes materok-el rismater-es ward-'er?
   where.DIST-ILL handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide-VERB
   "Where (unknown) does the handler guide the reed boat to?"
   ```
   "Where (unknown) does the handler guide the reed boat to?"
5. Semantic Notes

   - Proximal forms: Used for visible/known referents and confirmation
   - Medial forms: Used for sensed but not seen referents (sounds, smells, etc.)
   - Distal forms: Default information-seeking questions about unknowns
   - All forms take regular case marking based on syntactic role
   - Follow standard compound phonology (See: [Compound Phonology](#compound-phonology))

Would you like me to continue with the distal forms next?

## User:


[text]  
weren't we supposed to be doing distal forms already?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

You're absolutely right - let's continue with the distal forms, following the pattern shown in:


```889:893:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
3. Distal Forms (Out of Sight/Unknown)
   - 'atum [ʔa.tum] < 'aka-tal-um "where" (unknown location)
   - 'alum [ʔa.lum] < 'aka-'al-um "who" (unknown person)
   - 'atum [ʔa.tum] < 'aka-tal-um "where" (unknown location)
   - 'etelum [ʔe.te.lum] < 'aka-tel-um "when" (unknown time)
```


Here are the distal form entries:

Would you like me to add any additional semantic notes or usage examples based on the documentation?

## User:


[text]  
let's double check if we have the interrogatives propery in the @lexicon.jsonld 


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Let me check the interrogative entries we need against what's in the lexicon.jsonld file. From the documentation:


```874:893:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
1. Basic Forms
   - 'alis [ʔa.lis] < 'aka-'al-is "who" (what-person-PROX.ANIM)
   - 'aka [ʔa.ka] "what" (basic question root)
   - 'alis [ʔa.lis] < 'aka-'al-is "who" (what-person-PROX.ANIM)
   - 'atal [ʔa.tal] < 'aka-tal-is "where" (what-place-PROX.INAN)
   - 'atel [ʔa.tel] < 'aka-tel-is "when" (what-time-PROX.INAN)
   - 'aker [ʔa.ker] < 'aka-'er-is "how" (what-VERB-PROX.INAN)

2. Medial Forms (Hidden but Sensed)
   - 'ateth [ʔa.teθ] < 'aka-tal-eth "where" (sensed location)
   - 'aleth [ʔa.leθ] < 'aka-'al-eth "who" (sensed person)
   - 'ateth [ʔa.teθ] < 'aka-tal-eth "where" (sensed location)
   - 'eteleth [ʔe.te.leθ] < 'aka-tel-eth "when" (sensed time)
   - 'akereth [ʔa.ke.reθ] < 'aka-'er-eth "how" (sensed manner)

3. Distal Forms (Out of Sight/Unknown)
   - 'atum [ʔa.tum] < 'aka-tal-um "where" (unknown location)
   - 'alum [ʔa.lum] < 'aka-'al-um "who" (unknown person)
   - 'atum [ʔa.tum] < 'aka-tal-um "where" (unknown location)
   - 'etelum [ʔe.te.lum] < 'aka-tel-um "when" (unknown time)
```


We need these interrogative forms:

1. Basic form:
- 'aka "what"

2. Proximal forms:
- 'alis "who"
- 'atal "where" 
- 'atel "when"
- 'aker "how"

3. Medial forms:
- 'aleth "who"
- 'ateth "where"
- 'eteleth "when" 
- 'akereth "how"

4. Distal forms:
- 'alum "who"
- 'atum "where"
- 'etelum "when"
- 'akerum "how"

We have the distal forms ('atum, 'etelum, 'akerum) properly defined, but we're missing:

1. The basic form ('aka)
2. All proximal forms ('alis, 'atal, 'atel, 'aker)
3. All medial forms ('aleth, 'ateth, 'eteleth, 'akereth)
4. One distal form ('alum)

Would you like me to provide the JSON-LD entries for the missing interrogative forms?

## User:


[text]  
I actually see the basic form. but some proximal forms 'atal in particular is missing. I also changes 'eteleth to 'ateleth. 'etelum to 'atelum


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

You're right. Let me add the missing proximal form 'atal and fix those naming inconsistencies. Looking at:


```877:879:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - 'alis [ʔa.lis] < 'aka-'al-is "who" (what-person-PROX.ANIM)
   - 'atal [ʔa.tal] < 'aka-tal-is "where" (what-place-PROX.INAN)
   - 'atel [ʔa.tel] < 'aka-tel-is "when" (what-time-PROX.INAN)
```


The proximal forms should be:
- 'atal [ʔa.tal] < 'aka-tal-is "where" (what-place-PROX.INAN)

And from:


```885:886:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - 'ateth [ʔa.teθ] < 'aka-tal-eth "where" (sensed location)
   - 'eteleth [ʔe.te.leθ] < 'aka-tel-eth "when" (sensed time)
```


The medial form should be:
- 'ateleth [ʔa.te.leθ] (not 'eteleth)

And from:


```892:893:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - 'atum [ʔa.tum] < 'aka-tal-um "where" (unknown location)
   - 'etelum [ʔe.te.lum] < 'aka-tel-um "when" (unknown time)
```


The distal form should be:
- 'atelum [ʔa.te.lum] (not 'etelum)

Here's the missing proximal form entry:

```json:data/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.jsonld

```

Would you like me to update the entries for 'ateleth and 'atelum as well to fix the naming inconsistencies?

## User:

let's check the existence of the interrogatives again


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Let me check the interrogatives we need against the documentation in lines:


```873:893:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md

1. Basic Forms
   - 'alis [ʔa.lis] < 'aka-'al-is "who" (what-person-PROX.ANIM)
   - 'aka [ʔa.ka] "what" (basic question root)
   - 'alis [ʔa.lis] < 'aka-'al-is "who" (what-person-PROX.ANIM)
   - 'atal [ʔa.tal] < 'aka-tal-is "where" (what-place-PROX.INAN)
   - 'atel [ʔa.tel] < 'aka-tel-is "when" (what-time-PROX.INAN)
   - 'aker [ʔa.ker] < 'aka-'er-is "how" (what-VERB-PROX.INAN)

2. Medial Forms (Hidden but Sensed)
   - 'ateth [ʔa.teθ] < 'aka-tal-eth "where" (sensed location)
   - 'aleth [ʔa.leθ] < 'aka-'al-eth "who" (sensed person)
   - 'ateth [ʔa.teθ] < 'aka-tal-eth "where" (sensed location)
   - 'eteleth [ʔe.te.leθ] < 'aka-tel-eth "when" (sensed time)
   - 'akereth [ʔa.ke.reθ] < 'aka-'er-eth "how" (sensed manner)

3. Distal Forms (Out of Sight/Unknown)
   - 'atum [ʔa.tum] < 'aka-tal-um "where" (unknown location)
   - 'alum [ʔa.lum] < 'aka-'al-um "who" (unknown person)
   - 'atum [ʔa.tum] < 'aka-tal-um "where" (unknown location)
   - 'etelum [ʔe.te.lum] < 'aka-tel-um "when" (unknown time)
```


Required interrogatives:

1. Basic form:
- 'aka "what"

2. Proximal forms:
- 'alis "who"
- 'atal "where" 
- 'atel "when"
- 'aker "how"

3. Medial forms:
- 'aleth "who"
- 'ateth "where"
- 'ateleth "when" 
- 'akereth "how"

4. Distal forms:
- 'alum "who"
- 'atum "where"
- 'atelum "when"
- 'akerum "how"

Let me propose adding any missing entries in lexicon.jsonld. Would you like me to provide the JSON-LD entries for any missing interrogatives?

Note: We should also ensure that 'eteleth and 'etelum are consistently renamed to 'ateleth and 'atelum throughout the lexicon.

## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Let me verify all interrogative forms from the documentation. Here's what we need:

1. Basic root:
- 'aka [ʔa.ka] "what"

2. Proximal forms (-is):
- 'alis [ʔa.lis] "who"
- 'atal [ʔa.tal] "where"
- 'atel [ʔa.tel] "when"
- 'aker [ʔa.ker] "how"

3. Medial forms (-eth):
- 'aleth [ʔa.leθ] "who"
- 'ateth [ʔa.teθ] "where"
- 'ateleth [ʔa.te.leθ] "when"
- 'akereth [ʔa.ke.reθ] "how"

4. Distal forms (-um):
- 'alum [ʔa.lum] "who"
- 'atum [ʔa.tum] "where"
- 'atelum [ʔa.te.lum] "when"
- 'akerum [ʔa.ke.rum] "how"

Here's the JSON-LD entry for the basic root:

We've successfully covered all interrogative forms and their variants, including:

1. Basic root ('aka)
2. Proximal forms ('alis, 'atal, 'atel, 'aker)
3. Medial forms ('aleth, 'ateth, 'ateleth, 'akereth)
4. Distal forms ('alum, 'atum, 'atelum, 'akerum)

And we've fixed the naming inconsistencies by standardizing 'eteleth → 'ateleth and 'etelum → 'atelum throughout the entries.

Would you like me to do anything else with the interrogative system?

5. Semantic Notes

   - Proximal forms: Used for visible/known referents and confirmation
   - Medial forms: Used for sensed but not seen referents (sounds, smells, etc.)
   - Distal forms: Default information-seeking questions about unknowns
   - All forms take regular case marking based on syntactic role
   - Follow standard compound phonology (See: [Compound Phonology](#compound-phonology))
````


We can construct a proximal "where" question using 'atal [ʔa.tal], which is used for visible/known locations. Here's an example following the pattern shown in the usage examples:

```plaintext
'atal-aes materok-el rismater-es ward-'er?
where.PROX-ILL handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide-VERB
"Where (that we can see) does the handler guide the reed boat to?"
```

This uses:
- 'atal (proximal "where")
- -aes (illative case) since we're asking about a destination
- The same sentence structure as the distal example but with the proximal form

The proximal form implies the speaker expects the answer to be about a visible or known location, perhaps pointing to or indicating visible landmarks along the shore or river.

## User:


[text]  
so "where is the store" would use the distal form?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Actually, for "where is the store" we would likely use the proximal form 'atal if the store is a known, established location in the community, even if we can't see it at the moment of speaking. This follows from the semantic notes in:


```912:914:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - Proximal forms: Used for visible/known referents and confirmation
   - Medial forms: Used for sensed but not seen referents (sounds, smells, etc.)
   - Distal forms: Default information-seeking questions about unknowns
```


The proximal forms are used for "visible/known referents and confirmation", not just currently visible things. The distal form 'atum would be more appropriate for asking about an unknown location, like "where can I find a store?" when visiting a new place.

So "where is the store?" would be:

```plaintext
'atal-es mater-es ter-'er?
where.PROX-ABS store-ABS be-VERB
"Where is the store?" (asking about known location)
```

The distal form would be used more like:

```plaintext
'atum-es mater-es ter-'er?
where.DIST-ABS store-ABS be-VERB
"Where is there a store?" (asking about unknown location)
```

## User:


[text]  
I was thinking that copula is null? why is atal using the absolutive?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Ah, you're right! Looking at:


```321:323:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   ʔal-es ter-ʔer
   person-ABS move-ACT
   "The person moves"
```


We can see that intransitive verbs take absolutive marking, but copula constructions aren't shown explicitly.

Let me revise the example. Since copula is null in Early Hick, we should have:

```plaintext
'atal mater?
where.PROX store
"Where is the store?" (asking about known location)
```

And similarly for the distal:

```plaintext
'atum mater?
where.DIST store
"Where is there a store?" (asking about unknown location)
```

No case marking is needed since these are copular constructions. Thank you for the correction!

## User:


[text]  
I think we have null copula but will still have abs erg markings. I'm just asking why the question word would have abs marking in these cases?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Ah, looking at the case marking examples in:


````311:324:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - -el [el] (ERG): marks agent of transitive verbs
   - -es [es] (ABS): marks patient of transitive & sole argument of intransitive
   - -el [el] (ERG): marks agent of transitive verbs
   Examples:

   ```plaintext
   materok-el ʔal-es ward-ter
   handler-ERG person-ABS direct-to
   "The handler directs the person"
   handler-ERG person-ABS direct-to
   ʔal-es ter-ʔer
   person-ABS move-ACT
   "The person moves"
   ```
````


You're absolutely right. The absolutive case (-es) marks:
1. The patient of transitive verbs
2. The sole argument of intransitive verbs

In a copular construction like "Where is the store?", neither "where" nor "store" is functioning as a patient or sole argument of an intransitive verb - it's an equative construction. So my earlier suggestion to use absolutive case was incorrect.

Let me revise the examples:

```plaintext
'atal mater?
where.PROX store
"Where is the store?" (asking about known location)

'atum mater?
where.DIST store
"Where is there a store?" (asking about unknown location)
```

The interrogative words and their referents in copular constructions should appear without case marking, while still maintaining case marking in non-copular constructions as shown in the examples in:


````896:908:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   ```plaintext
   'alis-el materok-es ward-'er?
   who.PROX-ERG boat-ABS guide-VERB
   "Who (that we can see) guides the boat?"
   who.PROX-ERG boat-ABS guide-VERB
   'aleth-el thral-es his-'er?
   who.MED-ERG ritual-ABS watch-VERB
   "Who (that we can hear/sense) watches the ritual?"
   who.MED-ERG ritual-ABS watch-VERB
   'atum-aes materok-el rismater-es ward-'er?
   where.DIST-ILL handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide-VERB
   "Where (unknown) does the handler guide the reed boat to?"
   ```
````


## User:


[text]  
so 'atal should have agreement with the referrent here?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at lines 311-323 and line 915 of _index.md, we can see that case marking follows syntactic role, and absolutive marks both the patient of transitive verbs and the sole argument of intransitive verbs.

In a copular construction like "Where is the store?", "store" would be the subject complement, and in Early Hick it appears that both the interrogative and its referent should take absolutive marking since they're equated and functioning as a single argument:

```plaintext
'atal-es mater-es?
where.PROX-ABS store-ABS
"Where is the store?" (asking about known location)
```

This follows the pattern shown in lines 321-323 where single arguments take absolutive marking, and line 915's note about regular case marking based on syntactic role.

The same would apply to the distal form:

```plaintext
'atum-es mater-es?
where.DIST-ABS store-ABS
"Where is there a store?" (asking about unknown location)
```

## User:

You're right - in a copular construction asking about location, we should have:

```plaintext
'atal-es matiltel-es?
where.PROX-ABS store-ABS
"Where is the store?" (asking about known location)
```

The absolutive marking on both elements makes sense because they form a single argument in an equative construction, similar to how absolutive marks the sole argument of intransitive verbs. This follows the pattern shown in the examples where absolutive marks core arguments.

## User:


[text]  
ok, so it's unlikely to use an ergative markel‽ like 'atalel matilteles"?


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the case marking rules and examples:


````311:324:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   - -el [el] (ERG): marks agent of transitive verbs
   - -es [es] (ABS): marks patient of transitive & sole argument of intransitive
   - -el [el] (ERG): marks agent of transitive verbs
   Examples:

   ```plaintext
   materok-el ʔal-es ward-ter
   handler-ERG person-ABS direct-to
   "The handler directs the person"
   handler-ERG person-ABS direct-to
   ʔal-es ter-ʔer
   person-ABS move-ACT
   "The person moves"
   ```
````


And the interrogative examples:


````896:908:site/@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/_index.md
   ```plaintext
   'alis-el materok-es ward-'er?
   who.PROX-ERG boat-ABS guide-VERB
   "Who (that we can see) guides the boat?"
   who.PROX-ERG boat-ABS guide-VERB
   'aleth-el thral-es his-'er?
   who.MED-ERG ritual-ABS watch-VERB
   "Who (that we can hear/sense) watches the ritual?"
   who.MED-ERG ritual-ABS watch-VERB
   'atum-aes materok-el rismater-es ward-'er?
   where.DIST-ILL handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide-VERB
   "Where (unknown) does the handler guide the reed boat to?"
   ```
````


You're right - 'atal-el would be incorrect here because in a copular construction ("where is X"), neither element is acting as an agent of a transitive verb. The ergative -el specifically "marks agent of transitive verbs" (line 311).

The absolutive -es is used for:
1. Patient of transitive verbs
2. Sole argument of intransitive verbs

So in "Where is the store?", both elements form a single equated argument, taking absolutive marking:

```plaintext
'atal-es matiltel-es?
where.PROX-ABS store-ABS
"Where is the store?"
```

The ergative would only be used if the interrogative word is acting as the agent of a transitive verb, as shown in the example "'alis-el materok-es ward-'er?" (lines 897-899).

'isa as snake from protohick hihasa animate vine


## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Looking at the pattern of animacy marking and compound reduction shown in lines 57-59 and 73-76, and following the format of animal terms shown in lines 481-492, I would suggest adding:

```markdown
- 'isa [ʔi.sa] "snake" < Proto-Hick *hi-hasa → 'isa
  ([animacy prefix](@/languages/hickic/proto-hick.md#animacy-marking))

  Note: Shows archaic animacy marking through glottal prefix; derived from "animate vine"

This follows the established patterns:
1. Animacy marking with glottal prefix ('i- < *hi-)
2. Compound reduction (*hi-hasa → 'isa)
3. Cross-reference to sacred terms (like other significant animals)
4. Preservation of the semantic connection to "vine" in the etymology note

This would fit in the "Animals" section around line 481.
