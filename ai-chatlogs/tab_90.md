The decline of *Ritma* from the 3rd century onward reshaped this relationship. While other imperial regions struggled with deteriorating logistics and communication, Senera's established maritime infrastructure allowed it to maintain relatively stable governance. When Kalassus fell in 466, Senera was uniquely positioned to transition smoothly into independence, only formally declaring itself a kingdom after the fall of the Potol region to the Tandoor.

The Maidenfeld dynasty emerged during this transition period, establishing their rule over an intact administrative system. Unlike the chaos that engulfed much of the former empire, Senera maintained functional government institutions throughout the collapse. Their close relationship with Sanery, which remained stable until the 450s due to its coastal position, allowed both regions to preserve much of their shared Kalassarian heritage.

The fix simply breaks the long lines into segments of 80 characters or less. Each line is wrapped at natural breaking points (like spaces between words) to maintain readability while satisfying the MD013 line length rule.
