# Day 2

Setting: L'Illes Descargar  
Cast of Characters (Additions):

- Atroya
  - Senior member of the Hags of Estrega
- Various Shipwrights
  - Working on La Carnalis' repairs

Hedwig woke early, around 5 in the morning before sunrise. She found herself
drawn to a game of poker being played by some of the crew members, though she
admitted to not knowing how to play. The sailors were happy to teach her the
Nuran rules, and to their surprise (and perhaps chagrin), Hedwig managed to win
95 silver pieces. The only condition placed on her winnings was that she help
clean up before 6 AM.

After cleaning up from the poker game, Hedwig began planning her day. She needed
to speak with the captain about Sister Sierre's preaching - a delicate matter,
given that many crew members were pagans who might not welcome Orthodox
Masochist sermons aboard ship. The crew's reaction to such preaching might
remind them too much of their experiences with Poasah, where the Orthodox faith
was often imposed rather than welcomed.

She also arranged to go swimming with the hags later, inviting Cotto, Somme,
Dom, and Sister Sierre to join. Dom seemed particularly embarrassed by their
enthusiastic cheering for the hags, though he agreed to come along.

When they arrived at the Shriek Shack, Atroya was already waiting for them. She
knelt in the middle of a ritual circle when Hedwig entered, greeting her with a
simple "You have arrived" in formal Estregan. The hag's manner of speech was
notably different from the local dialect - more refined, almost aristocratic in
its precision.

During their conversation, Atroya revealed more about what she had sensed during
Hedwig's massage the previous day. She could tell that Hedwig was a hexblood -
specifically one created through the intervention of the Hags of Hama. This was
significant, as the Hags of Hama were considered almost mythical, a legendary
coven whose powers far exceeded what modern hags like the Estrega coven could
achieve. They were known to have helped barren couples conceive through magical
means, creating powerful hexbloods in the process.

Atroya admitted that her own coven, the Hags of Estrega, were still
rediscovering what it truly meant to be hags. The knowledge and abilities of the
Hags of Hama remained largely a mystery to them, though they aspired to reclaim
such ancient wisdom.

As part of the demonstration, Atroya produced a bird and released it within the
ritual circle. The bird took flight but struck an invisible barrier. When it
fell, injured, Hedwig instinctively cast Cure Wounds to heal it. Once restored,
the bird attempted flight again, this time successfully escaping when Atroya
touched the circle, causing it to disappear.

After the demonstration, they began dressing themselves once more. During their
conversation, Atroya explained how the hags used what they called "glamour" -
magical illusions that could disguise even something as large as a ship, though
she noted it was limited to mere disguise rather than true invisibility. Such
magic could prove invaluable for La Carnalis, potentially allowing them to evade
the Seneran patrols already searching for them.

The hags served various teas during their conversation - kelp tea, black tea
with a dash of milk, and rose tea. As they sipped their drinks, the discussion
turned to matters of faith. Sister Sierre explained some aspects of the Divine
Masochist church, particularly noting that the Venerable Matron had documented
sexual proclivities - most famously becoming a slave to the daughter of the
governor of Arzhadad.

The conversation then shifted to the Reformist Church, a splinter group of
Divine Masochists. Unlike the orthodox church, the Reformists believed the Devil
of Hubris wasn't real, claiming everything was part of Orthodoxy. They had even
corrupted their own Angel of Delight's teachings, insisting that everyone must
enjoy pain. Hedwig, drawing from her Nuran upbringing, contrasted this with how
they followed the Angel of Civilization in her homeland.

The discussion grew more serious as they touched upon the Reformists' true
nature. In southern Poasah, they had been steadily expanding their influence,
working behind the scenes to promote slavery and oppression. Sister Sierre
explained that while the orthodox church had its strictures, the Reformists
represented something far more sinister - religious tyranny masked as
enlightenment, though much of their work remained clandestine.

The contrast between the two branches of faith was stark. Where orthodox Divine
Masochists like Sister Sierre sought personal enlightenment through willing
submission to pain, the Reformists believed in forcing their interpretation of
pleasure and pain onto others. Their insistence that "everyone must enjoy pain"
had become a tool of control rather than a path to spiritual growth.

The conversation turned to more recent matters in Rainoso. Atroya spoke of a
group claiming to be the Hags of Hama that had appeared about two years ago.
These women had been embedding themselves in various positions throughout the
city, particularly as chambermaids aboard Seneran ships - much like spies.
However, something about their claims didn't seem to align with what was known
of the true Hags of Hama.

Sister Sierre suggested a troubling possibility - that these might actually be
Reformist agents masquerading as the legendary coven. The timing of their
appearance coincided with the Reformists' expanding influence, and their methods
of infiltration seemed more political than magical. Atroya agreed that these
women didn't demonstrate the deep connection to ancient powers that true Hags of
Hama were said to possess.

During their conversation, Hedwig noticed Somme lurking near the Shriek Shack's
entrance. Though he didn't speak Estregan, his voyeuristic tendencies were
apparent - he seemed to be trying to eavesdrop on the conversations inside. The
hags had apparently banned him from entering the premises due to his perverted
behavior, though they still allowed him to wait outside and communicate with
clients. As Atroya put it, his presence was "bad for business."

The conversation was interrupted by Cotto, who had followed them to the Shriek
Shack despite his earlier reluctance. His presence seemed to intrigue Atroya,
who noted that he too appeared to be seeking the Hags of Hama, though for
different reasons. As a paranormal investigator interested in the occult, Cotto
hoped the Hags might help him understand his own nature as a Cornups.

Cotto shared his own history with the group. His family had once lived along the
Poasan border, where territorial disputes were common. He spoke of how nobles
would sometimes make sport of the local population, particularly during military
campaigns. In one such incident, his uncle and several children were forced to
flee into the woods while noblemen hunted them for entertainment. Though such
actions were never officially sanctioned, they represented the growing
aggression of Poasan forces toward border communities.

Later, in their shared quarters, Hedwig found herself increasingly uncomfortable
with Somme's behavior. Though he didn't speak Estregan, he had been lurking
around the Shriek Shack, trying to eavesdrop on conversations. The hags had
banned him from entering due to his perverted tendencies, though they still
allowed him to communicate with clients outside. As Atroya had put it, he was
"bad for business."

Now, in their private conversation, Somme's voyeuristic interest focused
directly on Hedwig. He kept pressing her about her visit to Cotto's room - #6 -
and tried to provoke her by suggesting the possibility of simultaneous sexual
encounters with both Cotto and Dom. When this failed to get the reaction he
wanted, he offered to lend her a book called "The Flasher Barmaid" - a story
about a barmaid whose husband became impotent and whose wife worked at a bar
before becoming barren. Despite her strict upbringing as a duke's daughter,
Hedwig found herself intrigued by the prospect of such a salacious read. She
masked her interest with a philosophical observation that "books should be
free" - meaning that literature should be enjoyed regardless of its content or
context.

Though she tried to focus on her thoughts, Hedwig remained acutely aware of
Somme's presence across the room. His occasional glances from behind his writing
desk sent conflicting waves of discomfort and unwanted excitement through her.
To distract herself, she turned her mind to what she had learned about hags.
They were women who had discovered how to access Ritma through their bodies'
natural processes - not just creating life, but sustaining it. Instead of
gestating children, they could gestate pure nuggets of energy. A coven, she
recalled, derived from the word 'covenant' - a pact between women who shared
this power.

Her thoughts turned to the Hags of Hama she sought. There were stories of a
group claiming to be them, but something felt wrong about their claims. These
women had been operating in Rainoso for about two years, embedding themselves as
spies throughout the city, particularly in Seneran households. But the true Hags
of Hama were said to have access to all knowledge, could grant temporary
fertility, and possessed powers far beyond mere espionage.

Sister Sierre's suggestion that these might be Reformist agents troubled her.
The region didn't have many people open with their religion, making it easier
for such deceptions to take root. Unlike true hags, these women didn't openly
show their enjoyment of pain - a telling detail given the Reformists' particular
relationship with pain and pleasure.

If she was to continue her search, Rainoso would be her best lead. The city sat
on Raibon Island, the second largest in the chain. Perhaps there, among the
winding streets and hidden alcoves of the port city, she might find some trace
of the true Hags of Hama.

To break the uncomfortable silence, Hedwig asked Somme about Port Rainoso and
Raibon Island, particularly about the recent activities there. Somme seemed to
welcome the change in atmosphere, sharing what he knew. His family had lived
along the Poasan border, where territorial disputes were common. During military
campaigns, Poasan nobles would sometimes make sport of the local population. He
spoke of a particularly haunting incident where his uncle and several children
were forced to flee into the woods while noblemen hunted them for entertainment.
Though such actions were never officially sanctioned, they represented the
growing aggression of Poasan forces toward border communities.

This led to discussion of his current work. Somme explained that La Camaraderie
lacked access to magic users, making them eager to recruit people with such
abilities. He admitted they didn't know the full extent of Hedwig's powers, but
her knowledge of infiltration made her valuable as backup. He then spoke of
their next mission - liberating prisoners from the Splits, the notorious prison
complex atop the Admiralty's Helm in Surrey-on-the-Brams. Something strange had
happened there - prisoners had been inexplicably ordered by a Seneran commander
to stop their activities and march back to their ship for incarceration.

Somme explained that La Camaraderie's intelligence network operated differently
from traditional spy rings. Rather than maintaining direct agents in key
positions, they relied on a web of information gathered from various sources -
"like leaves in a tree," as he put it. He mentioned they had captured some spies
recently, likely from the group claiming to be the Hags of Hama. These women had
been embedding themselves as chambermaids aboard Seneran ships for the past two
years. The spies proved remarkably well-trained, refusing to talk and only
smirking when questioned. Their true nature was only discovered through journals
found in their possession.

"Keeping the peace," Somme said with a hint of irony, describing the official
reason given for the strange incident at the Splits. But something about the way
those prisoners had simply marched back to their ship troubled him. It wasn't
natural behavior, suggesting some form of coercion or control that La
Camaraderie hadn't encountered before.

Feeling the weight of the day's events, Hedwig mentioned her fatigue and decided
to rest for a while. When she awoke later, she found the room empty - Somme had
left while she slept. She decided to head to Cotto's room.

During their conversation, Cotto brought up her fighting prowess during the
recent Mirian boarding attempt. He had been impressed by her technique. Hedwig
mentioned it was Capoeira, though she was deliberately vague about why she had
learned it, only noting that it was popular among assassins. The implication
hung in the air, adding another layer of mystery to her already enigmatic
background.

The mention of assassins seemed to stir something in Cotto. He began sharing his
own history, of how his family had lived along the Poasan border, where
territorial disputes were common. His voice grew tight as he described how
Poasan nobles would sometimes make sport of the local population during military
campaigns. In one such incident, his uncle and several children were forced to
flee into the woods while noblemen hunted them for entertainment. Though such
actions were never officially sanctioned, they represented the growing
aggression of Poasan forces toward border communities.

Their conversation was interrupted by members of the cooking staff looking for
Hedwig - it was time to prepare dinner.

In the kitchen, Hedwig worked alongside the fish handler - she couldn't quite
remember his name, though she knew it was Carl. As they gutted fish for the
evening stew, she learned he was from Carlmark. He spoke of Daneland to the
north, which he called Topland in his native tongue, where children were allowed
to choose their own names. "Everyday I learn a lot of things here," Hedwig mused
to herself, feeling somewhat embarrassed at having forgotten his name for so
long. He had even taught her an old sailor's superstition - wearing a man's
unwashed shirt the next day was supposed to bring good fortune.

Noting there was no sign of Seneran patrols, Carl turned to more practical
matters. "How have you cured your seasickness, pal?" he asked, remembering her
struggles during the first leg of their journey. He shared various remedies:
just smelling whiskey rather than drinking it, ginger tea, a mixture of lemon
and ginger, chamomile, and the simple solution of opening a window for fresh
air.

When the food was ready, Hedwig helped serve what the sailors jokingly called
"slop" - though she noted that their fish stew, fresh and well-seasoned, was far
better fare than what most ships offered their crews.

After the meal service, Sister Sierre waved Hedwig over in the mess hall. The
nun wanted to make a trip to the platform to buy some supplies, and Hedwig
mentioned she needed to look for new dresses herself, given that her previous
one had been ruined during the Seneran attack.

As they prepared to leave, Hedwig noticed Craçoix watching them with his usual
disdain. The first mate's rudeness was becoming a pattern, though she chose to
ignore him for now. Sister Sierre seemed unbothered, her serene demeanor a stark
contrast to the first mate's barely concealed contempt.

Upon reaching the platform's modest clothing shop, Sister Sierre remarked that
most stores rarely stocked nun's habits. Yet surprisingly, this establishment
had exactly the style worn by the Order of the Angel of Delight. Hedwig found
this coincidence suspicious - more likely the result of smugglers' recent cargo
than divine providence.

While browsing through the available dresses, Hedwig found herself lamenting the
loss of her favorite garment. The Seneran attack had not only damaged the ship
but had cost her one of the few connections to her former life as a noblewoman -
a dress that had been both beautiful and practical for her new seafaring
existence.

As they were finishing their shopping, Dom appeared with Cotto in tow. The
Cornups looked distinctly uncomfortable, wearing some clothes that Dom had
apparently convinced him to try beneath his usual concealing cloak. Dom
suggested they could all visit the public baths together - a proposition that
seemed to make Cotto even more uneasy.

During their walk to the baths, they passed several food vendors. Cotto, perhaps
in an attempt to distract himself from his discomfort, sampled some fermented
fish from one of the platform stalls - his first taste of the local delicacy.
His reaction was a mixture of surprise and cautious appreciation, though the
pungent aroma made him wrinkle his nose.

The public baths turned out to be a modest establishment two blocks away from
what locals called the "Shrieking Shack" - the hags' establishment they had
visited earlier. Unlike the more refined bathhouses Hedwig had frequented in
Salicy, this was a mixed facility, not separated by gender as was common in some
places.

To pass the time while they soaked, Dom produced a silver piece and suggested a
game of "Sink the Coin." The rules were simple - drop the coin into the deeper
end of the bath, and whoever could retrieve it first would win the round.

"Let's make it interesting," Hedwig suggested with a predatory grin. Her
proposed wagers made Dom shift uncomfortably: if she won, he would have to flash
himself to Somme, Sister Sierre would serve him some mysterious concoction of
her choosing, and Cotto would need to spend a night with Hedwig. The stakes were
bold, even for their usual games, but pride prevented anyone from backing down.

As the game progressed, Hedwig's competitive nature emerged. Her quick movements
and keen eye helped her spot the coin's glint through the water, and she soon
found herself winning more rounds than losing. Even Sister Sierre's surprising
agility couldn't match Hedwig's determination. When the final round ended,
Hedwig emerged triumphant, her victory made sweeter by the thought of collecting
on her various wagers - particularly the one involving Cotto.

Upon their return to La Carnalis, Captain de la Fouet called Hedwig aside. Her
work in the ship's kitchen had not gone unnoticed - the quality of meals had
improved markedly since she'd started helping, and the crew's morale with it.
The captain made it official, promoting her from deckhand to a permanent
position in the Mess. It was a significant step up from scrubbing the decks, and
Hedwig couldn't help but feel a small surge of pride, though she suspected the
reassignment might have more to do with Somme being Quartermaster - this new
position would give them more legitimate reasons to interact.

The captain then announced to all present that they would soon be setting sail
for Rainoso. Everyone would receive their share and bonus from the loot they had
acquired during their previous raids - a welcome supplement to their regular
wages. The journey to Rainoso would take approximately five days, weather
permitting.

# Day 3-4: Detour Through the Sorrowful Havens

Setting: The Sorrowful Havens, southeastern region of L'Illes Apgarie

La Carnalis departed from L'Illes Descargar with favorable winds, but their
journey was soon complicated by two factors: a rapidly approaching storm and the
sighting of Seneran frigates patrolling the main route to Rainoso. Captain de la
Fouet, unwilling to risk another confrontation so soon after their recent
repairs, ordered a course change toward the Sorrowful Havens - a dangerous but
potentially useful detour through the eastern islets of L'Illes Apgarie.

The Sorrowful Havens were a collection of small, mostly uninhabited islands that
few captains dared navigate due to their treacherous channels and hidden shoals.
Fortunately, Somme possessed charts detailing some of the safer passages, making
this risky route possible for a ship of La Carnalis's size.

As the storm intensified, the crew worked tirelessly to keep the ship on course.
Timon, from his position in the crow's nest, spotted a potential anchorage
between two larger islands - a natural cove that might accommodate their vessel.
Captain de la Fouet ordered them to make for this shelter, though the narrow
entrance would require precise navigation.

During the difficult approach to the cove, La Carnalis scraped against rocks at
the entrance, causing minor damage to the hull that would need repair before
they could continue their journey. Once safely anchored within the protected
waters, the captain announced they would remain there until the storm passed and
repairs could be completed.

Sister Sierre seemed unusually tense about their location, mentioning to Hedwig
that local sailors called this part of L'Illes Apgarie "The Witches' Spine" and
generally avoided it when possible. When pressed for details, she merely cited
"old sailors' tales" but her demeanor suggested genuine concern.

That evening, several crew members reported hearing strange singing from the
densely forested shore during the worst of the storm - women's voices carried on
the wind, though no one could make out the words. Craçoix dismissed these
reports as "superstitious nonsense," though Timon insisted he had seen lights
moving among the trees, like lanterns carried by invisible hands.

The following morning, with clear skies but repairs still underway, Captain de
la Fouet organized a shore party to gather fresh water and hunt for game, as
their supplies had been intended for a direct journey to Rainoso. Hedwig, Dom,
and Cotto volunteered, along with several other crew members.

Before departing for shore, Hedwig considered her signet ring - a family
heirloom that, due to her hexblood nature, she could infuse with a portion of
her essence to create a telepathic bond with whoever wore it. Such a connection
could prove valuable if they encountered trouble on the island, but it would
also create an intimate link that she was hesitant to share with just anyone.
She decided to prepare the ring with her essence, though she remained undecided
about whom to entrust with it.

The shore party assembled their gear - weapons, water skins, and hunting
equipment. As they prepared to depart in the ship's boats, Hedwig noticed Cotto
seemed particularly interested in the island, his tome of arcane knowledge
clutched tightly to his chest. When she asked about his interest, he explained
that according to his research, these islands once served as meeting places for
covens from across the region, particularly during storms when the boundary
between realms was said to be thinnest.

"Do you think there could be a connection to the Hags of Hama?" Hedwig asked
quietly.

Cotto adjusted his chain - not from his Pact of the Tome with Mephistopheles,
but a personal affectation he wore nonetheless. "It's possible," he replied.
"The timing seems... significant."

As they boarded the boats, Hedwig wondered what they might discover on the
island, and whether it would bring her any closer to understanding her hexblood
heritage and the voices that had guided her this far.

Upon reaching the shore, Captain de la Fouet expressed concern about whether
other parts of the cove might be deep enough for La Carnalis to berth closer to
land, which would make loading supplies easier once they were gathered. "We need
to know if there are any hidden rocks or shoals that could damage the hull
further," he said.

"I'll dive down and check the depth," Hedwig volunteered, already stripping down
to appropriate swimming attire. The captain agreed, and Somme was assigned to
accompany her in one of the smaller boats to mark any dangerous areas.

As Hedwig explored the underwater terrain, she discovered something unexpected
on the sandy bottom - a wooden chest, partially buried in silt. With
considerable effort, she managed to bring it to the surface. Somme helped her
haul it into their boat and row back to shore where the rest of the landing
party had begun setting up camp.

The chest, once opened, revealed several women's dresses, including a somewhat
sheer pure white one that seemed remarkably well-preserved despite its apparent
age. Beneath the clothing was a gold-plated jewelry box. The box wasn't locked,
and contained two smaller containers lined with blue velvet, each holding an
engagement ring bearing a family crest. The rings were set with real rubies, and
Hedwig could sense a faint magical energy emanating from the gemstones.

Curious, Hedwig slipped one of the rings onto her finger. Immediately, she felt
the magic trickle through her body, and her attention was drawn to the pure
white dress among the pile. Cotto, intrigued by Hedwig's reaction, tried on the
other ring.

The change was immediate and unsettling. Hedwig's features shifted subtly, her
bearing and mannerisms transforming as confusion clouded her eyes. Beside her,
Cotto's form seemed to straighten, his usual hesitant demeanor replaced by one
of noble bearing. They stared at their surroundings, then at each other, with
growing bewilderment.

"Masra?" Cotto spoke, but his voice carried an unfamiliar aristocratic lilt. He
was no longer Cotto, but seemed to believe himself to be someone else entirely.

"My prince," Hedwig responded, her voice carrying traces of an accent not her
own. "What... where are we? This isn't our ship."

The others watched in alarm as Hedwig and Cotto conversed as if they were
different people, speaking of an escape from an arranged marriage and plans for
a new life. Dom attempted to intervene, trying to pull the rings from their
fingers, but to everyone's horror, the bands seemed fused to their skin.

"I can't get it off!" Dom exclaimed, tugging at the ring on Hedwig's finger.
"It's like it's become part of her hand!"

"Those are cursed," Sister Sierre declared, making a protective sign. "Or
perhaps possessed by the spirits of their former owners."

Sister Sierre attempted a blessing over the rings, reciting prayers from the
Order of the Angel of Delight, but nothing happened. Though devout in her faith,
she possessed no divine magic to counter such powerful enchantments. "I'm
sorry," she said, shaking her head. "I'm just a nun, not a cleric with holy
powers. This is beyond my abilities."

"What about you?" Somme asked Cotto, who now carried himself with the regal
bearing of Prince Hubar. "Can your... patron help?"

"I don't understand what you're rferring to," Cotto replied in Prince Hubar's
aristocratic tone. "I have no patron. I am Crown Prince Hubar of Estrega, and
this is my betrothed, Masra."

Hedwig - or rather Masra - nodded in agreement, clinging to Cotto's arm. "We
were sailing to Raibon to start a new life together, away from the arranged
marriage his father had planned with Princess Karni of Anasai."

The shore party exchanged worried glances. Whatever personalities had been
trapped in the rings had now completely overtaken Hedwig and Cotto. Their own
identities seemed suppressed beneath these foreign personas.

"We need to get them back to the ship," Captain de la Fouet decided. "Perhaps
there's someone aboard with knowledge of such curses. And if not, we'll need to
find help in Rainoso."

As they gathered their supplies to return to La Carnalis, "Masra" picked up the
white dress from the chest. "This was to be my wedding gown," she said
wistfully. "We were to be married upon reaching Mauricia."

"And we shall be, my love," "Hubar" assured her. "This delay is merely
temporary."

The shore party continued their assigned tasks, gathering fresh water from a
stream and hunting for game, but the transformation of their companions had cast
a shadow over their expedition. As they worked, Dom couldn't shake the feeling
that they were being watched from the depths of the forest - and he wondered if
whatever presence lurked there might be connected to the cursed rings that had
claimed their friends.

Back aboard La Carnalis, still anchored in the protected cove while repairs
continued, Captain de la Fouet called for an assessment of the situation. The
chest and rings were estimated to be worth around 500 gold pieces for their
material value alone, but their historical and magical significance likely made
them far more valuable to the right buyer.

Somme, drawing on his knowledge as a former fence and his extensive reading,
recognized the family crest on the rings. "If I'm not mistaken," he said,
examining the design without touching the rings, "this is the royal seal of the
Estregan monarchy from the Silver Kingdom period."

He retreated to his quarters and returned with a leather-bound volume titled
"History of Estrega, Stories of Estregan Nobility." Flipping through the pages,
he found what he was looking for.

"Here," he said, pointing to an illustrated page. "Crown Prince Hubar of
Estrega, heir to King Raibon I. According to this account, he disappeared at sea
around 955 AI, near the end of the First Anasaian-Estregan War."

The others gathered around to look at the illustration, which depicted a
handsome, aristocratic young man bearing a striking resemblance to how Cotto now
carried himself.

"The prince was betrothed to Princess Karni of Anasai as part of a peace
arrangement to end the war," Somme continued reading. "However, he reportedly
fell in love with a tavern dancer from the old capital - a woman of Ahurian
descent named Masra."

Sister Sierre gasped. "That's the name Hedwig called herself!"

Somme nodded grimly. "The account states that Prince Hubar and Masra attempted
to flee to Raibon Island - which was then called Mauricia - to escape the
arranged marriage. Their ship was lost in a storm, and neither was ever seen
again."

"The war ended shortly thereafter," he added, "but without the royal wedding to
cement relations. Instead, Estrega claimed control over the archipelago that
would later be named L'Illes Apgarie, including these islands we're sheltering
in now."

"So the rings..." Dom began.

"Must have belonged to the prince and his lover," Somme finished. "Likely
enchanted or cursed to preserve their spirits - or at least their memories and
personalities - after death."

Captain de la Fouet frowned. "Is there any mention of how to break such a
curse?"

Somme shook his head. "Not in this volume. The historical accounts focus more on
the political implications of the prince's disappearance than on the magical
aspects of the story."

"What about the chest and the dress?" Sister Sierre asked. "Could they have been
part of the couple's belongings?"

"It seems likely," Somme replied. "The white dress Masra claimed was her wedding
gown matches the description in the book of what she was reportedly seen wearing
when they fled. The preservation of these items after so many centuries is
remarkable - suggesting some form of enchantment was used to protect them."

"So what do we do with them now?" Dom asked, gesturing toward Hedwig and Cotto,
who sat quietly together, speaking softly to each other in their assumed
identities.

"We continue to Rainoso as planned," Captain de la Fouet decided. "The repairs
to La Carnalis should be complete by morning. Once there, we can seek out
someone with the magical knowledge to break this curse."

"And in the meantime?" Sister Sierre asked.

"We treat them with care," the captain replied. "Whatever has happened to them,
they're still our crew members and passengers. And who knows - perhaps their
current state might reveal more about this historical mystery."

As the meeting dispersed, Dom approached Somme privately. "Do you think there's
more to this story than what's in your book?" he asked. "Something about this
feels... deliberate."

Somme considered this. "History is often written by the victors," he said
finally. "The official account of Prince Hubar's disappearance was recorded by
those who benefited from his absence. There could very well be aspects of the
story that were deliberately omitted or altered."

Dom nodded thoughtfully. "I suppose we'll learn more as this unfolds. Let's just
hope we can get Hedwig and Cotto back to themselves before we reach Rainoso."

"Indeed," Somme agreed, though his expression suggested he wasn't entirely
confident in that outcome.

The following day, while repairs to La Carnalis continued, "Hubar" and "Masra"
seemed to have settled more deeply into their assumed identities. They spoke of
their plans for a new life together on Mauricia, far from the political
machinations of the Estregan court.

"My father arranged the betrothal to Princess Karni without consulting me,"
"Hubar" explained to Sister Sierre over breakfast. "It was to be the final peace
agreement that would end the war with Anasai."

"Masra" nodded, her hand resting on "Hubar's" arm. "The royal court would never
have accepted me - a common dancer with Ahurian blood. They called me a
distraction, a temporary amusement."

"But she is so much more," "Hubar" said with conviction. "Masra understands the
common people in ways the nobility never could. Together, we planned to
establish a new kind of governance on Mauricia - one that would serve as an
example to both Estrega and Anasai."

Sister Sierre listened with fascination, recognizing that they were receiving a
first-hand account of historical events, albeit through the strange possession
of their companions. "And your father, the king - he wouldn't consider allowing
the match?"

"Hubar" laughed bitterly. "My father sees only political advantage. The Anasaian
alliance was too valuable to sacrifice for what he called 'a youthful
indiscretion.' He ordered me to end my relationship with Masra immediately."

"Instead, we made plans to flee," "Masra" continued. "We gathered what valuables
we could, chartered a ship in secret, and set sail during a storm when the
harbor patrols were minimal."

Dom, who had been listening nearby, joined the conversation. "If you don't mind
my asking, how did you meet? A crown prince and a tavern dancer don't typically
move in the same circles."

"Masra" smiled, a hint of Hedwig's mischievousness briefly visible in her
expression. "I performed at a celebration marking a military victory. The prince
was... captivated."

"I had never seen such grace," "Hubar" said, his eyes fixed on "Masra" with
genuine affection. "I arranged to meet her privately after the performance."

"And the rest, as they say, is history," "Masra" finished with a laugh.

Captain de la Fouet approached their table. "We'll be setting sail within the
hour," he announced. "The repairs are complete, and the weather looks
favorable."

As the group dispersed to prepare for departure, Somme pulled Dom aside. "Did
you notice?" he asked quietly.

"Notice what?"

"Their story doesn't quite match the historical account," Somme replied. "My
book mentions nothing about plans to establish a new form of governance on
Mauricia. It portrays their relationship as a scandalous affair, not a political
partnership."

Dom considered this. "Perhaps the historical records were sanitized to protect
the reputation of the royal family? Or maybe..."

"Or maybe what we're hearing isn't the complete truth either," Somme finished.
"These are spirits trapped in rings for centuries - who knows how their memories
and motivations might have been altered by such an experience."

Later that day, while the ship's carpenters worked on repairing the hull damage,
Somme approached "Hubar" with a brass compass he had found among the ship's
navigational tools. "Does this look familiar to you, Your Highness?" he asked,
testing a theory.

"Hubar" examined the compass with interest. "It's similar to one I owned, though
mine had silver inlay around the edge." He turned it over in his hands, then
pressed what appeared to be a decorative element on its side. To Somme's
surprise, a hidden compartment in the compass base slid open.

"Many royal instruments contained secret compartments," "Hubar" explained. "For
messages that couldn't be entrusted to regular couriers."

Somme nodded thoughtfully. "And who typically had access to these secret
compartments? Just the royal family?"

"Hubar" hesitated, a flicker of uncertainty crossing his face. "The royal
family, yes, and... certain trusted advisors." For a moment, his aristocratic
demeanor faltered, and Cotto's more hesitant nature seemed to emerge. "I...
there's something I should remember about this."

The moment passed quickly, and "Hubar" was once again fully in control. But
Somme had noticed the brief lapse and made a mental note to pursue this line of
questioning further.

That afternoon, while examining the chest and other items recovered from the
cove, Dom discovered something interesting - a false bottom in one of the
drawers of the jewelry box. Beneath it lay a folded piece of parchment,
remarkably preserved despite its age.

"It appears to be a letter," Dom said, carefully unfolding it. "But it's written
in old Estregan script. I can't make it out."

"Let me see," said "Masra," reaching for the document. As her fingers touched
the parchment, she drew back with a sharp intake of breath, as if burned. For a
moment, Hedwig's voice emerged. "There's strong magic in that paper."

Then, just as quickly, "Masra" returned. "Forgive me," she said, her accent once
again prominent. "I felt... strange for a moment."

Somme took the document instead, examining it without touching the text
directly. "It appears to be some kind of manifest or inventory," he said. "There
are numbers and what might be cargo listings."

"The ship's manifest perhaps?" Sister Sierre suggested.

"Possibly," Somme replied. "But why hide it in a secret compartment? And why
would it trigger such a reaction?"

That evening, as the crew gathered for the evening meal, Captain de la Fouet
announced that repairs were nearly complete and they would set sail for Rainoso
at first light. The news was met with general approval - everyone was eager to
leave the mysterious cove behind.

"Hubar" and "Masra" exchanged glances at this news, their expressions a mixture
of hope and apprehension. "We're almost there, my love," "Hubar" said quietly.
"Soon we can begin our new life."

"Yes," "Masra" replied, though her smile seemed forced. "Our new life."

Later, as most of the crew retired for the night, Dom found Somme in his
quarters reviewing his notes on the cursed rings and their historical context.

"I've been thinking," Dom said, closing the door behind him. "What if the
quartermaster of their ship was involved in their disappearance?"

Somme looked up with interest. "What makes you say that?"

"Something 'Hubar' said about trusted advisors having access to secret
compartments. And the way 'Masra' reacted to that document - almost as if she
recognized it, but not in a good way."

"You think they might have been betrayed?" Somme asked.

Dom nodded. "The historical record says they were lost in a storm. But what if
that's not the whole story? What if someone on their ship - perhaps the
quartermaster - was working against them?"

"It would explain why their spirits seem so... unsettled," Somme mused. "Unaware
that they never reached their destination, still believing they're on their way
to a new life."

"And if we're right," Dom added, "then perhaps understanding the true
circumstances of their deaths might be key to breaking the curse."

Somme considered this. "We should be careful how we approach this. If they were
indeed betrayed, revealing that truth too abruptly might cause unpredictable
reactions in the spirits possessing our friends."

"Agreed," Dom said. "But we're running out of time. Once we reach Rainoso, who
knows what will happen when they realize it's not the Mauricia they remember?"

As they discussed potential approaches, neither noticed the shadow that briefly
passed by Somme's door - someone who had been listening to their conversation
with great interest.

The following morning, La Carnalis departed from the cove with favorable winds,
setting course for Rainoso. As the mysterious islands of the Sorrowful Havens
receded behind them, "Hubar" and "Masra" stood at the rail, their posture and
expressions those of two people who believed they were finally continuing their
journey to freedom, unaware that their actual fate had been sealed centuries
ago.

That night, as most of the crew slept, Hedwig - still possessed by Masra's
spirit

- found herself drawn to the white wedding dress they had recovered from the
  chest. She had kept it carefully folded in her quarters, but now felt an
  irresistible urge to try it on. As she slipped the garment over her head, she
  felt a strange sensation - as if the fabric itself were alive, clinging to her
  skin with unnatural persistence.

The dress seemed to shimmer in the dim light of her cabin, and for a moment,
Hedwig's true consciousness surfaced. "Something's wrong," she whispered, but
Masra's personality quickly reasserted control.

"I must go," she murmured, her eyes glazed. "I must return."

Moving like a sleepwalker, she made her way to the deck and over the side of the
ship into a small boat. No one noticed as she lowered herself into the water and
began rowing back toward the islands they had just left.

It was Somme who discovered her absence during his predawn watch. Alarmed, he
quickly alerted the captain and organized a search party. They found the missing
boat and realized she must have returned to the Sorrowful Havens.

"We have to go back," Somme insisted. "Something about that dress... I should
have been more careful with it."

Captain de la Fouet ordered the ship to change course, returning to the cove
they had just left. Upon arrival, "Hubar" - still in possession of Cotto's
body - became agitated.

"She's gone to the caves," he said with certainty. "There's something there...
something we were meant to find."

A search party consisting of Somme, Dom, "Hubar," and several crew members set
out for the island. They discovered footprints in the sand leading away from the
shore and into the dense forest. Following the trail, they came upon a series of
caves hidden among the rocks.

"Hubar" hesitated at the entrance. "I remember this place," he said, his voice
trembling. "But I shouldn't. We never made it this far."

Inside the largest cave, they found Hedwig standing motionless in the wedding
dress, which now seemed to glow with an eerie light. The fabric rippled around
her body as if stirred by an unfelt wind.

"Masra," "Hubar" called out, stepping forward.

At the sound of his voice, Hedwig turned. Her face contorted with an expression
that belonged neither to herself nor to Masra, but something darker and filled
with malice.

"You fool," she spat, her voice unnaturally deep. "You never suspected, did you?
That your precious Masra was sent to destroy you?"

"What are you talking about?" "Hubar" demanded, confusion evident on his face.

"I was never a simple dancer," the voice continued, using Hedwig's mouth. "I was
an agent of Anasai, tasked with preventing your marriage to Princess Karni. The
peace between our kingdoms would have disadvantaged certain... interests in
Anasai."

As she spoke, the dress began to constrict around Hedwig's body, tightening like
a vise. She gasped in pain, momentarily breaking through the possession. "Help
me," she managed to say in her own voice before being subsumed once more.

"John of Estrega and Matthew Strandiz of Anasai orchestrated it all," the
malevolent voice continued. "They needed the war to continue. I was to seduce
you, lead you away from your kingdom, your responsibilities. And I succeeded
beyond their expectations."

"No," "Hubar" whispered, staggering back. "It can't be true."

"But it is," the voice laughed cruelly. "Your love was real, Prince Hubar. Mine
was not. At least... not at first."

The dress tightened further, and Hedwig cried out in agony. Somme, realizing the
danger, rushed forward with his dagger drawn.

"The dress is cursed!" he shouted. "It's feeding on their guilt and rage - both
Hubar's and Masra's!"

As he approached, tendrils of fabric lashed out like whips, striking him across
the face. Dom and the others tried to intervene but were similarly repelled.

"I was supposed to lead you to your death," the voice continued, now tinged with
sorrow. "But I fell in love with you, truly. When I tried to abort the plan, to
save you... the quartermaster, who was also in their employ, took matters into
her own hands. She sabotaged the ship during the storm. We never had a chance."

"Hubar" - or perhaps Cotto breaking through - suddenly straightened with
resolution. "Then we both were betrayed," he said. "And we've been trapped in
these rings, reliving our final journey, never knowing the truth."

The dress constricted again, and Hedwig collapsed to her knees. Somme, seeing
his opportunity, lunged forward and grabbed the fabric at its seam. With a
powerful slash of his dagger, he tore the dress from collar to hem.

A terrible scream filled the cave - not from Hedwig, but from the dress itself.
The fabric writhed as if in agony, then burst into spectral flames that gave off
no heat but consumed the material nonetheless.

As the last threads disintegrated, both Hedwig and Cotto gasped simultaneously.
The rings on their fingers loosened and fell to the ground with a soft clink.

"What... what happened?" Hedwig asked, her own voice restored as she looked
around in confusion.

Cotto seemed equally disoriented. "I remember everything," he said slowly. "Both
as myself and as... him. Prince Hubar."

Somme helped Hedwig to her feet. "The dress was the anchor for the curse," he
explained. "It contained the unresolved emotions of both spirits - Hubar's sense
of betrayal and Masra's guilt. When we destroyed it, we freed them... and you."

As they made their way back to the ship, Hedwig and Cotto compared notes on
their strange experience. Though the possession had ended, both retained
fragments of memories from the spirits that had inhabited them - glimpses of a
tragic love story manipulated by political machinations centuries ago.

"I feel sorry for them both," Hedwig said quietly as La Carnalis once again set
sail from the cove. "Masra may have begun with deception, but in the end, she
truly loved him."

"And he never knew the truth until now," Cotto added. "Perhaps that's why their
spirits couldn't rest."

Somme carefully placed the rings in a small wooden box. "What should we do with
these?" he asked.

"Keep them," Captain de la Fouet decided. "But separate. We'll find proper
custodians for them in Rainoso - perhaps the historical society or a temple that
can ensure they're handled with appropriate care."

As the Sorrowful Havens disappeared over the horizon, Hedwig felt a weight lift
from her shoulders. Though the experience had been harrowing, it had also given
her a strange sense of connection to the past - and perhaps some insight into
the complex political landscape that still shaped the region centuries later.

The journey to Rainoso resumed, with clear skies ahead and a favorable wind at
their backs. Whatever other mysteries awaited them there, at least this one
chapter had found its resolution.

# The Aftermath: Hedwig's Creative Response

In the days that followed their departure from the Sorrowful Havens, Hedwig
found herself processing the extraordinary experience through her art. The
possession by Masra's spirit had left her with lingering impressions and
emotions that weren't entirely her own—fragments of memories, desires, and
regrets from a woman who had lived centuries ago.

During the quiet evening watches, Hedwig began crafting a play inspired by the
tragic tale. She changed the names—Prince Hubar became Prince Cobar, and Masra
was transformed into Hag Marzia—partly out of artistic license and partly to
provide some distance from the raw experience she had endured. The story
retained the core elements of betrayal and doomed love, but Hedwig's version
added nuances that the historical accounts had omitted: the political
machinations of John of Estrega and Matthew Strandiz, the quartermaster's
treachery, and Masra's genuine transformation from spy to lover.

"It's quite good," Somme remarked one evening, peering over her shoulder at the
manuscript. "Though I suspect the Estregan royal family might not appreciate
this particular interpretation of their history."

Hedwig merely smiled. "History is written by the victors, isn't it? Perhaps it's
time for another perspective."

Beyond the play, Hedwig also began keeping a more personal journal. The
experience of being possessed had awakened something in her—a new awareness of
her body and desires that she had previously suppressed under the strict moral
code of her noble upbringing. In private pages that she kept carefully hidden
from Somme's voyeuristic tendencies, she explored these newfound feelings,
documenting her thoughts on pleasure, desire, and the unexpected liberation that
came with her journey away from the constraints of her former life.

"I was raised to believe that a duke's daughter should be above such base
instincts," she wrote one night by candlelight. "Yet I find there is wisdom in
the body that the mind alone cannot grasp. Perhaps this is part of what the hags
understand—that power flows not just from denial, but from embracing all aspects
of oneself."

As La Carnalis continued its journey toward Rainoso, Hedwig found herself
changed in subtle but significant ways. The possession had been frightening, but
it had also given her insight into a life vastly different from her own—a woman
who had navigated dangerous political waters, who had known both deception and
genuine passion. Though she was grateful to be herself again, she couldn't help
but feel that some small part of Masra remained with her, a whisper of another
woman's experience that had expanded her own understanding of the world.
