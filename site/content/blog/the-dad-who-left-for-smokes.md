It's been told in every joke show\
The dad that left for smokes, bag in tow\
Says to his kids, "I'll be right back."\
Then gone forever, no one to track

"Who would do that?", I used to think\
It's insane! Gone in a blink?\
Can't love his kids anymore?\
He just there left, out that door?

No longer that naive\
I know he didn't just leave\
The poor guy was just wrung dry\
So much pain, he done ran out of cry

It's selfish, that much is true\
And I will never take that cue\
But I now know why, folks\
Why that dad just left for smokes
