I dreamt that I was a puddle\
Amorphous on a city street\
Born from pipe, not from cuddle\
I laid there, stabbed by feet

Up above shone the sun\
Its painful rays shooting heat\
While for most it was fun\
I felt a lot less upbeat

Into vapor none can see\
Nothing to do but to stare\
While the radiance ate at me\
I slowly boiled into the air

Into vapor, no longer me\
As I boiled into the air\
Nothing is left of me\
For the radiance does not care
