title = "Sutra of the Servant, Bound"
+++

Of those in the Land of the People\
Whose appetites know no bounds\
Whose insatiable hunger for flesh\
Of both cow and of the hills\
Dictate their each and every act\

They must be cowed and brought low\
Shamed to the point of breakage\
Worked to the point of exhaustion\
Starved to the point neighboring death\

Only in this manner may they be untethered\
Only in this way may they be freed
