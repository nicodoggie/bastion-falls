# The Reformed Church of the Divine Masochist

{{ incomplete() }}

Formed in the years succeeding the Destruction of Bastion Cathedral, and the
Fall of Bastion itself, the Reformists, as they call themselves, broke off from
the orthodoxy in its entirety. The violent and apparently supernatural
destruction of the Cathedral had led them to believe that God himself had deemed
orthodox belief to be anathema to the True Way that the Divine Masochist led. 

Within 30 years since, they have, through unknown means, taken and unified the
Burtian lands surrounding Bastion, and have consolidated power under the rule of
a puppet warlord.
