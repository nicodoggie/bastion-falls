The Hick people are the native inhabitants of the island kingdom of
[Senera](@/locations/senera.md). Their identity has largely been subsumed by
the modern nation of Senera, but vestiges of their culture can still be found
in the form of various mystic and religious practices.

In the 1270s AI, there had been a movement to revive the Hick identity and
culture, particularly by an anti-monarchist group named  faction. This was partly due to
pressure from the Church of the Divine Masochis, which had been growing in
influence over the centuries, and which had been active in promoting a more
Hickic identity as part of its efforts to rediscover the lost mysticism of the
Kalassarians.
