The Hick language family is a group of related languages spoken in Senera. By
the time of the Fall of the Kalassarian Empire, the Hick languages were
supplanted by Classical Kalassarian. However, even during this time, local
speakers of Hick languages continued to use their languages in everyday life.

# Hick Sub-Families

## Seneran Hick

Seneran Hick considered the typifying language of the Hick family. The languages
of the Seneran Hick family are spoken in the main Seneran Island, and are the
substrates of the modern Seneran language.

## Straits Hick

This sub-family are a variety of languages spoken in the islands of the Princely
Straits. They include Palman, the language of Racos Palma, Sentimental Island
and Shagnery, and Moreaux.

## Apgarian Hick

It is widely debated whether or not the Apgarian Hick languages have diverged
directly from a hypothetical Proto-Hick, or whether they are instead a
descendant of one of the variants of Straits Hick. The fact that modern
descendants of Apgarian Hick are heavily influenced by Kalassarian, and have
continuous contact with Straits Hick languages as well as the surrounding
Apgarian languages, makes it difficult to determine the historical relationship
between the two groups.
