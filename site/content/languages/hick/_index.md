The Hick language family is a group of related languages spoken in Senera. These
languages have been mostly eradicated by the time of the Fall of the Kalassarian
Empire. Only a few dialects survive in modern Senera, mostly in the form of
place names and maritime terminology, and a few isolated communities.
