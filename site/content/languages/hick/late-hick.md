# Overview

Late Hick, also known as Early Seneran (105 AI - 400 AI), represents the crucial
transition period when Kalassarian influence began reshaping the Hick language
into what would become Modern Seneran.

# Historical Context

## Kalassarian Contact Period (105-400 AI)

- Kalassarian settlement begins
- Administrative language shifts
- Bilingual population emerges
- Maritime terminology preserved

### Consonant Inventory

| Manner       | Labial | Dental | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
| ------------ | ------ | ------ | -------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
| Stops        | p b    |        | t d      |         | k g   |         |
| Fricatives   | f v    | θ      | s        |         |       | h       |
| Nasals       | m      |        | n        |         | ŋ     |         |
| Liquids      |        |        | l r      |         |       |         |
| Approximants | w      |        |          | j       |       |         |

Notes:

- [ŋ] occurs only before velars
- [v] mainly from Iutlandish loans
- [θ] weakening except in sacred terms

1. Word-internal Changes:
   - Liquid deletion between consonants
   - Nasal simplification begins
   - New clusters from Kalassarian: [st], [sp], [nt]

#### Consonants from Iutlandish

1. Initial Clusters
   - Added /sk-/, /st-/ from Iutlandish loans
     - *skip → skip "ship"
     - *stál → stal "steel"
2. Final Consonants
   - Final /-f/ → /-v/ between vowels
     - *skif → skiv "small boat"
   - Final /-þ/ → /-d/ in borrowed terms
     - *smiþ → smed "smith"
3. Cluster Adaptations
   - Iut. /-lf-/ → Hick /-lv-/
     - *wulf → wulv "wolf"
   - Iut. /-rn-/ preserved
     - *isarn → isarn "iron"

### Vowel Inventory

| Height | Front | Central | Back |
| ------ | ----- | ------- | ---- |
| High   | i iː  |         | u uː |
| Mid    | e eː  | ə       | o oː |
| Low    | æ     | a aː    |      |

Notes:

- Length distinction weakening in unstressed syllables
- [ə] emerging as reduction of unstressed vowels
- [æ] mainly in Iutlandish loans

1. Long Vowels
   - Iut. /á/ → Hick /a/
     - *bát → bat "boat"
   - Iut. /é/ → Hick /e/
     - *fésk → fesk "fish"
2. Diphthongs
   - Iut. /ei/ → Hick /e/
     - *reiþ → red "ride"
   - Iut. /au/ → Hick /o/
     - *hauk → hok "hawk"

#### Vowel Changes from Iutlandish

### Diphthongs

- /ai/ from Kalassarian /ae/
- /au/ preserved in some ritual terms
- /ei/ from Iutlandish loans
- /oi/ from Kalassarian borrowings

### Vowel System

1. Unstressed Vowel Reduction:
   - /a/ → [ə] after stops
   - karan → [kə.ran] "stream"
   - Preserves [a] in:
     - Stressed syllables
     - Sacred terms
     - Recent borrowings

### Consonant System

## Stress Patterns

- Native pattern: ˈCV.CV
- Borrowed pattern: CV.ˈCV
- Compound stress varies by origin

## Sound Changes

### Initial Changes (105-300 AI)

1. Consonant Clusters

   - /θr/ → /r/ before /a/
     - thranaes → ranaes "delta"
   - /θr/ preserved in sacred terms
     - thran-val [θran.val] "blessing"

2. Vowel Changes
   - /ae/ → /a/ in unstressed syllables
     - bramaes → bramas
   - /i/ → /e/ in compounds
     - innis-bél → innesbel

### Later Changes (300-400 AI)

1. Kalassarian Influence
   - New clusters: [st], [sp], [nt]
   - Borrowed stress patterns
   - Administrative vocabulary

## Key Terms Development

1. Native Terms
   - innis-bél → innesbel
     - Vowel reduction: innis → innes
     - Compound stress shift
2. Early Borrowings
   - Surrata enters as [sur.ra.ta]
   - portus → porta
   -

# Vocabulary Development

## Preserved Hick Terms

Mainly in:

- Maritime vocabulary
- Geographic features
- Sacred/ritual terminology
- Place names

## Kalassarian Borrowings

- Administrative terms
- Urban terminology
- New technology terms
- Formal registers

# Sound Changes Leading to Modern Forms

## Key Terms Development

### Native Terms

1. innis-bél → Inespell

   - Unstressed vowel reduction: innis → ines
   - Consonant cluster simplification: -sb- → -sp-
   - Final vowel raising: -é- → -e-
   - Gemination: -l → -ll

2. bram-aes → Brams
   - Vowel sequence simplification: -ae- → ∅
   - Final -s preserved as marker of water feature

### Kalassarian Borrowings

1. Surrata → Surrey
   - Unstressed vowel syncope: -rata → -ry
   - Vowel quality shift: -y → -ey
   - Maintains initial stress pattern

### The Term "Hick"

Likely derived from Kalassarian "hiccus" [hik.kus] meaning "local, native":

- From administrative term "hiccus populus" (local people)
- Compare: "rusticus" (rural), "civicus" (civic)
- Simplified in military/administrative use to just "hiccus"
- Further shortened in common speech to "hick"

## Sound Change Patterns

1. Vowel Changes:

   - Unstressed reduction
   - Sequence simplification
   - Quality shifts in final position

2. Consonant Changes:
   - Cluster simplification
   - Gemination in certain environments
   - Final -s preservation in hydronyms
