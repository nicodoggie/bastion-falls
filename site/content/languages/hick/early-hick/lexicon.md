### Colors

With context, the word itself would be enough to mean the color, however to
disambiguate from other meanings, the
[Similarity Prefix](@/languages/hick/early-hick#similarity-marking) _ka-_ is
used.

Some color terms do not have other semantic categories, for example 'gra' lost
other meanings by Early Hick, this _ka-_ is unnecessary.
