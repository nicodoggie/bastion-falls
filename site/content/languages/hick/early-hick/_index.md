# Overview

The Hick language was the primary tongue of pre-Kalassarian Senera. While no
longer spoken, it survives in place names, maritime terminology, and religious
traditions throughout modern Senera.

A Kalassarian language grammatical sketch of Early and Middle Hick was
unearthed, along with a lexicon was found in an unsealed room underneath the
[Admiralty's Helm](@/locations/admiraltys-helm.md) in
[Surrey-on-the-Brams](@/locations/surrey-on-the-brams.md). Details in this is a
modern analysis of that sketch using modern linguistic methods.

Early Hick shows an ergative-absolutive alignment with rich derivational
morphology and a sophisticated spatial reference system. Core grammatical
relations are marked through suffixes, while derivational processes primarily
use prefixes.

A reconstruction of a hypothetical Proto-Hick is also provided, inferenced from
regional dialects and the historical development of Hick.

# Historical Development

## Pre-Hick Period (before ~600 PF)

While the exact developments remain unclear, comparison of Early Hick forms with
remnant vocabulary suggests several possible sound changes:

1. Final vowels begin devoicing in unstressed syllables
   - \*thralu > [ˈθra.lu̥]
   - \*wardu > [ˈwar.du̥]
   - \*taku > [ˈta.ku̥]

2. Devoiced vowels reduce to schwa
   - [ˈθra.lu̥] > [ˈθra.lə]
   - [ˈwar.du̥] > [ˈwar.də]
   - [ˈta.ku̥] > [ˈta.kə]

## Early Hick (~600 PF onward)

1. Final schwa deletion
   - [ˈθra.lə] > [ˈθral]
   - [ˈwar.də] > [ˈward]
   - [ˈta.kə] > [ˈtak]

- Purely oral tradition
- Core maritime and nature vocabulary established
- Complex compound system develops
- Sacred/ritual terminology crystallizes

## Middle Hick (300 PF to 105 AI)

- More consistent contact with pre-Kalassarian traders
- Maritime trade vocabulary expansion
- Astronomical terminology development
- Sacred site naming conventions formalize
- Initial written forms appear (borrowed script)

## Late Hick/Early Seneran (105 AI to 400 AI)

- Kalassarian settlement period begins
- Administrative terminology adoption
- Initial sound changes:
  - Unstressed vowel reduction begins
  - Compound simplification starts
  - Some liquid deletion word-internally

## Middle Seneran (400 AI to 900 AI)

- Major sound changes:
  - Full unstressed vowel reduction
  - Resyllabification for CV preference
  - Systematic liquid/nasal deletion
  - Stress-related vowel lengthening
- Example: [in.nes.bel] → [i.ne.spel]

## Modern Seneran (900 AI to present)

- Extensive contact with Apgarian kingdoms
- Final changes:
  - Complete syllable restructuring
  - Final cluster simplification
  - Vowel length phonemicization
- Example: [i.ne.spel] → [ine.spell]

# Proto-Hick Reconstruction

See: [Proto-Hick](@/languages/hick/proto-hick.md)

## Overview

Early Hick shows a relatively conservative phonological system inherited from
Proto-Hick, with significant changes occurring mainly in compound formation and
unstressed syllables. See: [Historical Development](#historical-development)

## Phonotactics

### Syllable Structure

- Basic Pattern: (C)(C)V(C)(C)
- Special Pattern: (C)(C)VV for permitted diphthongs
- Stress: Initial syllable unless marked

### Consonant Clusters

#### Initial Clusters

| Type    | Clusters                            | Examples         |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Common  | /br-, dr-, tr-, kr-, fl-, pl-, kl-/ | bram, dren, tral |
| Sacred  | /θr-/                               | thral, thren     |
| Archaic | /gn-, kn-/                          | gnal, knes       |

| ------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Common  | /-st, -sk, -sp/ | mest, risk, lisp |
| Limited | /-ks, -ls, -rs/ | teks, mals, tors |

See: [Sound Changes in Compounds](@/languages/hick/early-hick/compounds.md)

### Vowel Sequences

1. Permitted Diphthongs:

   - Within morphemes: /ai/, /ei/, /ae/
   - At morpheme boundaries:
     - /ei-ae/ → [e.e]
     - /ai-ae/ → [ae]
   - No three-vowel sequences

2. Examples:
   - /kei-aes/ → [ke.es] "sky flow"
   - /thrai-aes/ → [thraes] "sacred flow"
   - /brai-aes/ → [braes] "swift flow"

### Weight Distribution Constraints

1. Stress Patterns

   - Primary stress falls on first syllable of simple words
   - In compounds:
     - a. First element maintains primary stress
     - b. Second element reduces unless sacred/ritual term
     - c. Three-element compounds:
       - Primary stress on first element
       - Secondary stress on final element
       - Middle element reduces
   - Exceptions:
     - Sacred/ritual terms resist reduction
     - Maritime terms maintain second element weight
     - Recent compounds may preserve full weight
     - Morphological boundaries may preserve weight

   Examples:

   - tor-mal → [ˈto.məl] "great pool"
   - thral-kel → [ˈθral.kel] "sacred sky" (no reduction - sacred term)
   - tor-ma-ter → [ˈtor.mə.ˌter] "great-pool-flow"
   - bram-ma-ter → [ˈbram.ma.ˌter] "tide-vessel" (no reduction - maritime)

## Prosodic System

### Stress Patterns

1. Primary Stress
   - Falls on first syllable of root in isolation
   - Maintained in prefixation: ma-tor → [ˈma.tor]
   - Shifts in compounds: tor-mal → [tor.ˈmal]
2. Secondary Stress
   - In three-syllable compounds: tor-ma-ter → [ˈtor.mə.ˌter]
   - In prefix chains: ma-ka-tor → [ˈma.kə.ˌtor]
3. Stress-Related Changes
   - Unstressed /a/ → [ə]
   - Stressed vowels resist reduction
   - Compound stress affects vowel quality

## Compound Phonology

### Sound Changes in Compounds

1. Liquid Deletion

   - tor-mal → tomal "lake"
   - val-mal → vamal "spirit pool"
   - thral-gral → thragral "sacred earth"

2. Nasal Deletion

   - bram-mal → bramal "tidal pool"
   - bran-kel → brakel "morning sky"

3. Vowel Coalescence
   - kei-aes → kees "sky flow"
   - thrai-aes → thraes "sacred flow"

### Compound Types

1. Element + Element

   - kur-tin → kurtin "bronze" (copper-tin)
   - mal-ter → mater "stream" (pool-flow)

2. Descriptor + Element
   - gra-kur → grakur "grey copper"
   - tor-mal → tomal "great pool"

## Allophonic Rules

### Vowel Allophony

The vowel /a/ surfaces as [ə]:

1. After sibilants and affricates:

   - /sak/ → [sək] "wolf"
   - /sal/ → [səl] "stone"

2. After voiceless stops in unstressed syllables:

   - /karan/ → [kərən] "stream"
   - /tamal/ → [təmal] "pool-like"

3. In grammatical prefixes:

   - /ka-/ → [kə-] (similarity prefix)
   - /ma-/ → [mə-] (plural prefix) See:
     [Morphological Prefixes](@/languages/hick/early-hick/morphology.md#prefixes)

4. Between identical consonants:
   - /malam/ → [məlam] "pooled"
   - /ranar/ → [rənər] "flowing"

### Stress-Dependent Reduction

1. In Compounds:

   - First element maintains stress: 'tor-mal → ['tor.məl]
   - Second element reduced: mal-'ter → [məl.'ter]

2. With Prefixes:

   - Stressed prefix blocks reduction: 'ma-tor → ['ma.tor]
   - Unstressed prefix shows reduction: ka-'tor → [kə.'tor]

3. In Three-syllable Words:
   - Primary stress blocks reduction: 'ka-ra-nal → ['ka.rə.nəl]
   - Secondary stress partially blocks: ˌka-'ra-nal → [ˌka.'ra.nəl]

#### Exceptions

- Maintains [a] in:
  - Stressed syllables
  - Sacred/formal terms
  - Recent compounds See:
    [Sacred Terminology](@/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md#sacred--ritual)

### Consonant Allophony

[Section to be added]

## Historical Sound Changes

See: [Historical Development](#historical-development) for chronological stages

# Core Grammar

## Case System

1. Primary Cases

   - -el [el] (ERG): marks agent of transitive verbs
   - -es [es] (ABS): marks patient of transitive & sole argument of intransitive

   Examples:

   ```plaintext
   materok-el ʔal-es ward-ter
   handler-ERG person-ABS direct-to
   "The handler directs the person"

   ʔal-es ter-ʔer
   person-ABS move-ACT
   "The person moves"
   ```

2. Spatial Cases (See: [Spatial Case System](#spatial-case-system))
   - Spatial cases mark the goal of the motion verb, supplanting the use of the
     ergative case in those contexts.
     - -aes (ILL): "inward, into"
     - -imris (ELL): "outward, from"
     - -itar (SUPE): "upward, upon"
     - -esp (SUB): "under, below"
     - -asam (SUBE): "downward, onto"

### Development of the Ergative Case Marking -el

The Early Hick ergative marker -el derives from Proto-Hick \*mela through
parallel but distinct development from the definite article:

1. Sound Changes:

   - \*mela > \*mel (final vowel loss)
   - \*mel > -el (initial m-loss in unstressed position)

2. Functional Development:

   - Original meaning: definite animate marker
   - Intermediate stage: marks definite agents
   - Final stage: general ergative marker

3. Examples:
   - thral-el "the sacred one (as agent)"
   - mer-el "the bird (as agent)"
   - pel-el "the bear (as agent)"

   - ethis [eθ.is] "while"
   - umis [um.is] "or else"

# Morphology

## Nominal Morphology

### Agentive Marking

1. Primary Marker
   - -ok [ok]: agentive nominalizer (forms agent nouns, both occupational and
     active) Examples:
   - materok "boatman" < mater-ok "vessel-AGENT" (one who works with vessels)
   - wardok "guide" < ward-ok "direct-AGENT" (one who directs)
   - threnok "watcher" < thren-ok "watch-AGENT" (one who watches)

### Size and Intensity Markers

1. Diminutive (li-)

   - Prefix meaning "small, lesser"
   - Examples:
     - limal [li.mal] "small pool, pond"
     - liren [li.ren] "small deer, fawn"
     - lines [li.nes] "small fish, minnow"

2. Augmentative (tor-)
   - Prefix meaning "great, mighty" (from "height, peak")
   - Examples:
     - tornes [tor.nes] "great fish, whale"
     - topel [to.pel] "great bear" (tor-pel → topel, liquid deletion)
     - tomal [to.mal] "great pool, lake" (tor-mal → tomal, liquid deletion)
3. Speed Augmentative (tor- -sim)
   - Circumfix combining the argumentative tor- with the translative -sim to
     mean a swift change in speed of the action

### Number Marking

1. Plural Prefix (ma-)
   - Basic plural marker
   - Examples:
     - mator [ma.tor] "peaks, heights"
     - makel [ma.kel] "skies"
   - Interacts with case marking: ma-tor-el (PL-height-ERG)

### Similarity Marking

1. Similarity Prefix (ka-)
   - Prefix meaning "like, similar to"
   - Always surfaces as [kə-] due to regular vowel reduction
   - Examples:
     - ka-tor [kə.tor] "hill-like" (smaller than a mountain)
     - ka-mal [kə.mal] "pond-like" (smaller than a lake)
     - ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)
2. Usage Domains
   - Natural Features: kətor "hill-like", kəmal "pond-like"
   - Animals: kəpel "bear-like", kəmer "bird-like"
   - Body Parts: kəbel "mouth-like", kəven "wing-like"
   - Weather: kəbran "storm-like", kəthral "mist-like"
   - Water Movement: kəran "stream-like", kəthrim "wave-like"
   - Plant Growth: kəthir "grass-like", kəbel "vine-like"
   - Sounds: kəmer "bird-like (sound)", kəsak "wolf-like (howl)"

### Demonstrative System

1. Visible/Known
   - -is [is] "this" (inanimate)
   - -ʔis [ʔis] "this" (animate)
   - -en [en] "that" (inanimate)
   - -tan [tan] "that" (animate)
2. Hidden but Sensed
   - -eth [eθ] "this/that" (inanimate)
   - -thir [θir] "this/that" (animate)
3. Distant/Out of Sight
   - -um [um] "that" (inanimate)
   - -rum [rum] "that" (animate)

### Personal Reference

1. Spatial Demonstratives
   - istal "this.place-person" (speaker's location)
   - etal "that.place-person" (addressee's location)
   - utal "far.place-person" (third party location)

### Negation System

1. Basic Negation
   - mo- [mo]: general negation prefix Examples:
     - mo-thral "non-sacred, profane"
     - mo-ter "not flowing, stagnant"
     - mo-ward "misdirect, lead astray"

### Possession Marking

1. Basic Possession
   - -ul [ul]: possessive suffix Examples:
   - mater-ul "vessel owner"
   - thral-ul "ritual keeper"

## Verbal Morphology

### Verbalizer

- -'er ['er]: creates verbs from nouns and property concepts (See:
  [Proto-Hick](@/languages/hick/proto-hick.md#segmental-inventory))
- If -'er is preceded by a plosive, it surfaces as [er]

```plaintext
mulis-'er [mulis.ʔer] "dreaminɡ"
tak-er [tak.er] "strike"
```

1. Active verbs (from action/motion concepts):

   ```plaintext
   ai-es ter-'er
   water-ABS flow-VERB
   "Water flows"

   materok-el 'al-es ward-'er
   handler-ERG person-ABS guide-VERB
   "The handler guides the person"
   ```

   Examples:

   - ter-'er "to flow" (See:
     [Water Features](@/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md#water-features))
   - thren-'er "to watch" (See:
     [Sacred Terms](@/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md#sacred--ritual))
   - ward-'er "to guide"

2. Stative verbs (from property concepts):

   ```plaintext
   tor-thir-es thral-'er
   peak-KNOWN.ANIM-ABS sacred-VERB
   "The known peak is sacred"

   kel-es mar-'er
   sky-ABS red-VERB
   "The sky is red"
   ```

   Examples:

   - thral-'er "to be sacred" (See:
     [Sacred Terms](@/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md#sacred--ritual))
   - mar-'er "to be red" (See:
     [Colors](@/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md#colors))

Note: Interpretation depends on base word semantics:

- Action/motion roots → active verbs (ter "flow", ward "guide")
- Property roots → stative verbs (thral "sacred") (See:
  [Basic Terms](@/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md#basic-terms))

## Spatial Case System

Early Hick's spatial case system interacts closely with verbal semantics,
marking not only physical direction but also abstract state changes and
causation.

1. Basic Spatial Cases

   - -aes (ILL): "inward, into"
   - -imris (ELL): "outward, from"
   - -itar (SUPE): "upward, upon"
   - -asam (SUBE): "downward, onto"
   - -esp (SUB): "under, below"

2. Directional Usage

   ```plaintext
   materok-el rismater-aes
   handler-ERG reed.boat-ILL
   "The handler enters the reed boat"

   materok-el rismater-imris
   handler-ERG reed.boat-ELL
   "The handler exits the reed boat"

   materok-el rismater-itar
   handler-ERG reed.boat-SUPE
   "The handler climbs onto the reed boat"

   materok-el rismater-asam
   handler-ERG reed.boat-SUBE
   "The handler climbs down from the reed boat"
   ```

3. Change of State

   - Spatial cases extend to mark state changes
   - See: [Adjectival System](#adjectival-morphology) for full details

   ```plaintext
   kamar kel-es kakel-aes
   red sky-ABS blue-ILL
   "red sky turns blue"
   ```

4. Syntactic Properties
   - Supplants ergative case in motion contexts
   - Can be fronted for emphasis
   - Implies motion/change without overt verb
   - Interacts with causative constructions

## Adjectival Morphology

Early Hick has no true adjective class. Quality concepts are expressed through:

1. Stative Verbs (See: [Verbal Morphology](#verbal-morphology))

   - Uses verbalizer -ʔer
   - Takes absolutive argument Examples:

   ```plaintext
   kel-es kakel-ʔer
   sky-ABS blue-VERB
   "The sky is blue"

   thral-el kel-es kakel-ʔer
   ritual-ERG sky-ABS blue-VERB
   "The ritual makes the sky blue"
   ```

2. Change of State

   1. Translative (-sim):

      ```plaintext
      kel-es kakel-sim
      sky.ABS blue.TRANS
      "sky becomes blue"
      ```

   2. Directional Cases (-aes/-imris):

      ```plaintext
      kamar kel-es kakel-aes
      red sky-ABS blue-ILL
      "red sky turns blue"
      ```

3. Notes:
   - No attributive modification
   - All qualities are verbal predicates
   - Follows ergative-absolutive alignment
   - Causatives marked by adding ergative agent

## Derivational Morphology

### Similarity Prefix

- ka- [kə]: prefix meaning "like, similar to"
- Always surfaces as [kə-] due to regular vowel reduction Examples:
- ka-tor [kə.tor] "hill-like" (smaller than a mountain)
- ka-mal [kə.mal] "pond-like" (smaller than a lake)
- ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)

### Negation System

- mo- [mo]: general negation prefix Examples:
- mo-thral "non-sacred, profane"
- mo-ter "not flowing, stagnant"
- mo-ward "misdirect, lead astray"

### Compound Formation

- Basic Pattern: modifier-head
- Sound changes:
  - Liquid deletion: tor-mal → tomal
  - Nasal deletion: bram-mal → bramal Examples:
- kur-tin → kurtin "bronze" (copper-tin)
- bram-mater → brammater "river vessel" (tide-vessel)
- thral-kel → thrakel "sun" (sacred-sky)

### Body Metaphors

1. Breath as the soul
2. Liver as source of life
3. Heart as source of emotion
4. Bones as structure
5. Hands as tools
6. Eyes as reality
7. Skin as appearance

## Affix Order

### Basic Template

1. Root Structure

   - (PREFIX*) + ROOT + (SUFFIX*)
   - Maximum of three prefixes and two suffixes

2. Order of Elements

```plaintext
(NEG)-(SIZE)-(SIM)-ROOT-(AGENT)-(CASE)

```

Examples:

- mo-tor-el (NEG-height-ERG) "not the height (as agent)"
- li-ka-mal-ok-es (DIM-SIM-pool-AGENT-ABS) "small pool-like keeper (as patient)"
- tor-ka-mal-el (AUG-SIM-pool-ERG) "great pool-like thing (as agent)"

### Prefix Classes

1. Outer Prefixes (first position)
   - mo- (NEG): negation
   - ma- (PL): plural
2. Middle Prefixes (second position)
   - tor- (AUG): augmentative
   - li- (DIM): diminutive
3. Inner Prefixes (closest to root)
   - ka- (SIM): similarity
   - is- (PROX): proximate
   - eth- (MED): medial
   - um- (DIST): distal

### Suffix Classes

1. Inner Suffixes (closer to root)

   - -ok (AGENT): agentive
   - -er (ACT): active participant

2. Outer Suffixes (final position)
   - -el (ERG): ergative case
   - -es (ABS): absolutive case
   - -imris (ELL): ellative case
   - -aes (ILL): illative case

### Restrictions

1. Co-occurrence

   - Only one prefix from each position class
   - Maximum of one case suffix
   - Agent suffix must precede case suffix

2. Phonological Interactions
   - Prefix ka- always reduces to [kə-]
   - Liquid deletion applies across morpheme boundaries
   - Nasal deletion applies across morpheme boundaries

# Syntax

## Clause Structure and Word Order

1. Basic Patterns

   - Core arguments marked by case, allowing flexible word order
   - Ergative (-el) marks agent of transitive verbs
   - Absolutive (-es) marks patient of transitive & sole argument of
     intransitive
   - Word order signals pragmatic functions rather than grammatical roles

2. Information Structure

   - Initial position: topic/focus or temporal frame
   - Final position: new information or emphasis
   - Examples:

     ```plaintext
     branum bramisimris kethes
     past    river-ELL    sea-ABS
     "In the past, the river flowed to the sea" (temporal frame first)

     kethes bramisimris branum
     sea-ABS river-ELL    past
     "The river flowed to the sea, in the past" (neutral statement)
     ```

3. Verb Position and Aspect

   - Verbs can occur in different positions based on aspect:

     ```plaintext
     materok-el rismater-es ward tel
     handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide COMPL
     "The handler has guided the reed boat" (completed action)

     rismater-es ward kethes
     reed.boat-ABS guide sea-ABS
     "The reed boat guides to sea" (general statement)
     ```

   - Directional constructions allow goal prominence:
     ```plaintext
     keth-aes materok-el rismater-es
     sea-ILL  handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS
     "To sea the handler (takes) the reed boat"
     ```

4. Temporal Reference

   - Time words can float freely but tend toward:
     - Initial: setting temporal frame for discourse
     - Pre-verbal: marking temporal contrast
     - Final: neutral narrative position
   - Examples:

     ```plaintext
     branum materok-el ward-ʔer  # Frame-setting
     past    handler-ERG guide-VERB
     "In the past, the handler guided"

     materok-el branum ward-ʔer  # Temporal contrast
     handler-ERG past    guide-ACT
     "The handler USED TO guide"

     materok-el ward-ʔer branum  # Neutral narrative
     handler-ERG guide-ACT past
     "The handler guided, in the past"
     ```

See: [Tense and Aspect](#tense-and-aspect) for a complete description of:

- Past reference markers (branum, branrum)
- Future reference (mulsum)
- Completive aspect (tel)
- Position effects on temporal interpretation

## Tense and Aspect

1. Past Reference

   ```plaintext
   branum materok-el ward-'er
   past   handler-ERG guide-VERB
   "The handler guided (in the past)"
   ```
