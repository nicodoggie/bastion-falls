# Overview

The Hick language was the primary tongue of pre-Kalassarian Senera. While no
longer spoken, it survives in place names, maritime terminology, and religious
traditions throughout modern Senera.

# Historical Development

## Early Hick (prehistory to ~300 PF)

- Purely oral tradition
- Core maritime and nature vocabulary established
- Complex compound system develops
- Sacred/ritual terminology crystallizes

## Middle Hick (300 PF to 105 AI)

- More consistent contact with pre-Kalassarian traders
- Maritime trade vocabulary expansion
- Astronomical terminology development
- Sacred site naming conventions formalize
- Initial written forms appear (borrowed script)

## Late Hick/Early Seneran (105 AI to 400 AI)

- Kalassarian settlement period begins
- Administrative terminology adoption
- Initial sound changes:
  - Unstressed vowel reduction begins
  - Compound simplification starts
  - Some liquid deletion word-internally

## Middle Seneran (400 AI to 900 AI)

- Major sound changes:
  - Full unstressed vowel reduction
  - Resyllabification for CV preference
  - Systematic liquid/nasal deletion
  - Stress-related vowel lengthening
- Example: [in.nes.bel] → [i.ne.spel]

## Modern Seneran (900 AI to present)

- Extensive contact with Apgarian kingdoms
- Final changes:
  - Complete syllable restructuring
  - Final cluster simplification
  - Vowel length phonemicization
- Example: [i.ne.spel] → [ine.spell]

# Phonology

## Overview

Early Hick shows a relatively conservative phonological system inherited from
Proto-Hick, with significant changes occurring mainly in compound formation and
unstressed syllables. See: [Historical Development](#historical-development)

See: [Sound Changes in Compounds](@/languages/hick/early-hick/compounds.md)

### Vowel Sequences

1. Permitted Diphthongs:

   - Within morphemes: /ai/, /ei/, /ae/
   - At morpheme boundaries:
     - /ei-ae/ → [e.e]
     - /ai-ae/ → [ae]
   - No three-vowel sequences

2. Examples:
   - /kei-aes/ → [ke.es] "sky flow"
   - /thrai-aes/ → [thraes] "sacred flow"
   - /brai-aes/ → [braes] "swift flow"

## Prosodic System

### Stress Patterns

1. Primary Stress

   - Falls on first syllable of root in isolation
   - Maintained in prefixation: 'ma-tor → ['ma.tor]
   - Shifts in compounds: tor-'mal → [tor.'mal]

2. Secondary Stress

   - In three-syllable compounds: 'tor-ma-'ter → ['tor.mə.'ter]
   - In prefix chains: 'ma-ka-'tor → ['ma.kə.'tor]

3. Stress-Related Changes
   - Unstressed /a/ → [ə]
   - Stressed vowels resist reduction
   - Compound stress affects vowel quality

## Compound Phonology

### Sound Changes in Compounds

1. Liquid Deletion

   - tor-mal → tomal "lake"
   - val-mal → vamal "spirit pool"
   - thral-gral → thragral "sacred earth"

2. Nasal Deletion

   - bram-mal → bramal "tidal pool"
   - bran-kel → brakel "morning sky"

3. Vowel Coalescence
   - kei-aes → kees "sky flow"
   - thrai-aes → thraes "sacred flow"

### Compound Types

1. Element + Element

   - kur-tin → kurtin "bronze" (copper-tin)
   - mal-ter → mater "stream" (pool-flow)

2. Descriptor + Element
   - gra-kur → grakur "grey copper"
   - tor-mal → tomal "great pool"

## Allophonic Rules

### Vowel Allophony

The vowel /a/ surfaces as [ə]:

1. After sibilants and affricates:

   - /sak/ → [sək] "wolf"
   - /sal/ → [səl] "stone"

2. After voiceless stops in unstressed syllables:

   - /karan/ → [kərən] "stream"
   - /tamal/ → [təmal] "pool-like"

3. In grammatical prefixes:

   - /ka-/ → [kə-] (similarity prefix)
   - /ma-/ → [mə-] (plural prefix) See:
     [Morphological Prefixes](@/languages/hick/early-hick/morphology.md#prefixes)

4. Between identical consonants:
   - /malam/ → [məlam] "pooled"
   - /ranar/ → [rənər] "flowing"

#### Stress-Dependent Reduction

1. In Compounds:

   - First element maintains stress: 'tor-mal → ['tor.məl]
   - Second element reduced: mal-'ter → [məl.'ter]

2. With Prefixes:

   - Stressed prefix blocks reduction: 'ma-tor → ['ma.tor]
   - Unstressed prefix shows reduction: ka-'tor → [kə.'tor]

3. In Three-syllable Words:
   - Primary stress blocks reduction: 'ka-ra-nal → ['ka.rə.nəl]
   - Secondary stress partially blocks: ˌka-'ra-nal → [ˌka.'ra.nəl]

#### Exceptions

- Maintains [a] in:
  - Stressed syllables
  - Sacred/formal terms
  - Recent compounds See:
    [Sacred Terminology](@/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md#sacred--ritual)

# Morphology

## Overview

Early Hick shows an ergative-absolutive alignment with rich derivational
morphology and a sophisticated spatial reference system. Core grammatical
relations are marked through suffixes, while derivational processes primarily
use prefixes.

## Core Grammar

### Case System

1. Primary Cases

   - -el [el] (ERG): marks agent of transitive verbs
   - -es [es] (ABS): marks patient of transitive & sole argument of intransitive

   Examples:

   ```
   materok-el ʔal-es ward-ter
   handler-ERG person-ABS direct-to
   "The handler directs the person"

   ʔal-es ter-ʔer
   person-ABS move-ACT
   "The person moves"
   ```

2. Spatial Cases
   - -ris (ELL): motion away from
   - -im (ILL): motion into

### Agentive Marking

1. Primary Markers
   - -ok [ok]: forms agent nouns
   - -er [er]: forms active participant nouns Examples:
   - materok "boatman" < mater-ok "vessel-AGENT"
   - ward-er "guide" < ward "direct"

### Spatial Reference System

1. Basic Spatial Markers

   - ran (archaic locative): "at, in"
   - ris (archaic locative): "from, away" Examples:
   - is-ran "at this place"
   - eth-ran "at that place"
   - um-ris "away from that place"

2. Spatial Demonstratives
   - istel-ʔal "this.place-person" (speaker's location)
   - ethtel-ʔal "that.place-person" (addressee's location)
   - umtel-ʔal "far.place-person" (third party location)

### Conjunctions

1. Basic Connectors

   - is "and" (sequential)
   - eth "and" (simultaneous)
   - um "or"

2. Complex Connectors
   - isis "and then"
   - ethis "while"
   - umis "or else"

### Verbal System

1. Basic Verbalizer
   - -ʔer [ʔer]: creates active verbs Examples:
   - ter-ʔer "to flow" (flow-ACT)

   - keth-im "into the sea"
   - wad-aes "along the path"

2. Complex Directionals
   - -imris "through" (combination of -im and -ris) Examples:
   - mater-imris "through the vessel"
   - val-imris "through the valley"

## Nominal Morphology

### Size and Intensity Markers
