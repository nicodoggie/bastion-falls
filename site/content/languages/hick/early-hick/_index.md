# Overview

The Hick language was the primary tongue of pre-Kalassarian Senera. While no
longer spoken, it survives in place names, maritime terminology, and religious
traditions throughout modern Senera.

A Kalassarian language grammatical sketch of Early and Middle Hick was
unearthed, along with a lexicon was found in an unsealed room underneath the
[Admiralty's Helm](@/locations/admiraltys-helm.md) in
[Surrey-on-the-Brams](@/locations/surrey-on-the-brams.md). Details in this is a
modern analysis of that sketch using modern linguistic methods.

Early Hick shows an ergative-absolutive alignment with rich derivational
morphology and a sophisticated spatial reference system. Core grammatical
relations are marked through suffixes, while derivational processes primarily
use prefixes.

A reconstruction of a hypothetical Proto-Hick is also provided, inferenced from
regional dialects and the historical development of Hick.

# Historical Development

## Pre-Hick Period (before ~600 PF)

While the exact developments remain unclear, comparison of Early Hick forms with
remnant vocabulary suggests several possible sound changes:

1. Final vowels begin devoicing in unstressed syllables

   - \*thralu > [ˈθra.lu̥]
   - \*wardu > [ˈwar.du̥]
   - \*taku > [ˈta.ku̥]

2. Devoiced vowels reduce to schwa
   - [ˈθra.lu̥] > [ˈθra.lə]
   - [ˈwar.du̥] > [ˈwar.də]
   - [ˈta.ku̥] > [ˈta.kə]

## Early Hick (~600 PF onward)

1. Final schwa deletion
   - [ˈθra.lə] > [ˈθral]
   - [ˈwar.də] > [ˈward]
   - [ˈta.kə] > [ˈtak]

- Purely oral tradition
- Core maritime and nature vocabulary established
- Complex compound system develops
- Sacred/ritual terminology crystallizes

## Middle Hick (300 PF to 105 AI)

- More consistent contact with pre-Kalassarian traders
- Maritime trade vocabulary expansion
- Astronomical terminology development
- Sacred site naming conventions formalize
- Initial written forms appear (borrowed script)

## Late Hick/Early Seneran (105 AI to 400 AI)

- Kalassarian settlement period begins
- Administrative terminology adoption
- Initial sound changes:
  - Unstressed vowel reduction begins
  - Compound simplification starts
  - Some liquid deletion word-internally

## Middle Seneran (400 AI to 900 AI)

- Major sound changes:
  - Full unstressed vowel reduction
  - Resyllabification for CV preference
  - Systematic liquid/nasal deletion
  - Stress-related vowel lengthening
- Example: [in.nes.bel] → [i.ne.spel]

## Modern Seneran (900 AI to present)

- Extensive contact with Apgarian kingdoms
- Final changes:
  - Complete syllable restructuring
  - Final cluster simplification
  - Vowel length phonemicization
- Example: [i.ne.spel] → [ine.spell]

# Proto-Hick Reconstruction

## Overview

Early Hick shows a relatively conservative phonological system inherited from
Proto-Hick, with significant changes occurring mainly in compound formation and
unstressed syllables. See: [Historical Development](#historical-development)

See: [Sound Changes in Compounds](@/languages/hick/early-hick/compounds.md)

### Vowel Sequences

1. Permitted Diphthongs:

   - Within morphemes: /ai/, /ei/
   - At morpheme boundaries:
     - /ei-ae/ → [e.e]
     - /ai-ae/ → [ae]
   - No three-vowel sequences

2. Examples:
   - /kei-aes/ → [ke.es] "sky flow"
   - /thrai-aes/ → [thraes] "sacred flow"
   - /brai-aes/ → [braes] "swift flow"

### Weight Distribution Constraints

1. Stress Patterns

   - Primary stress falls on first syllable of simple words
   - In compounds:
     - a. First element maintains primary stress
     - b. Second element reduces unless sacred/ritual term
     - c. Three-element compounds:
       - Primary stress on first element
       - Secondary stress on final element
       - Middle element reduces
   - Exceptions:
     - Sacred/ritual terms resist reduction
     - Maritime terms maintain second element weight
     - Recent compounds may preserve full weight
     - Morphological boundaries may preserve weight

   Examples:

   - tor-mal → [ˈto.məl] "great pool"
   - thral-kel → [ˈθral.kel] "sacred sky" (no reduction - sacred term)
   - tor-ma-ter → [ˈtor.mə.ˌter] "great-pool-flow"
   - bram-ma-ter → [ˈbram.ma.ˌter] "tide-vessel" (no reduction - maritime)

## Prosodic System

### Stress Patterns

1. Primary Stress
   - Falls on first syllable of root in isolation
   - Maintained in prefixation: ma-tor → [ˈma.tor]
   - Shifts in compounds: tor-mal → [tor.ˈmal]
2. Secondary Stress
   - In three-syllable compounds: tor-ma-ter → [ˈtor.mə.ˌter]
   - In prefix chains: ma-ka-tor → [ˈma.kə.ˌtor]
3. Stress-Related Changes
   - Unstressed /a/ → [ə]
   - Stressed vowels resist reduction
   - Compound stress affects vowel quality

## Compound Phonology

### Sound Changes in Compounds

1. Liquid Deletion

   - tor-mal → tomal "lake"
   - val-mal → vamal "spirit pool"
   - thral-gral → thragral "sacred earth"

2. Nasal Deletion

   - bram-mal → bramal "tidal pool"
   - bran-kel → brakel "morning sky"

3. Vowel Coalescence
   - kei-aes → kees "sky flow"
   - thrai-aes → thraes "sacred flow"

### Compound Types

1. Element + Element

   - kur-tin → kurtin "bronze" (copper-tin)
   - mal-ter → mater "stream" (pool-flow)

2. Descriptor + Element
   - gra-kur → grakur "grey copper"
   - tor-mal → tomal "great pool"

## Allophonic Rules

### Vowel Allophony

The vowel /a/ surfaces as [ə]:

1. After sibilants and affricates:

   - /sak/ → [sək] "wolf"
   - /sal/ → [səl] "stone"

2. After voiceless stops in unstressed syllables:

   - /karan/ → [kərən] "stream"
   - /tamal/ → [təmal] "pool-like"

3. In grammatical prefixes:

   - /ka-/ → [kə-] (similarity prefix)
   - /ma-/ → [mə-] (plural prefix) See:
     [Morphological Prefixes](@/languages/hick/early-hick/morphology.md#prefixes)

4. Between identical consonants:
   - /malam/ → [məlam] "pooled"
   - /ranar/ → [rənər] "flowing"

### Stress-Dependent Reduction

1. In Compounds:

   - First element maintains stress: 'tor-mal → ['tor.məl]
   - Second element reduced: mal-'ter → [məl.'ter]

2. With Prefixes:

   - Stressed prefix blocks reduction: 'ma-tor → ['ma.tor]
   - Unstressed prefix shows reduction: ka-'tor → [kə.'tor]

3. In Three-syllable Words:
   - Primary stress blocks reduction: 'ka-ra-nal → ['ka.rə.nəl]
   - Secondary stress partially blocks: ˌka-'ra-nal → [ˌka.'ra.nəl]

#### Exceptions

- Maintains [a] in:
  - Stressed syllables
  - Sacred/formal terms
  - Recent compounds See:
    [Sacred Terminology](@/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md#sacred--ritual)

### Consonant Allophony

[Section to be added]

## Historical Sound Changes

See: [Historical Development](#historical-development) for chronological stages

# Core Grammar

## Ergative-Absolutive Alignment

- -el [el] (ERG): marks agent of transitive verbs
- -es [es] (ABS): marks patient of transitive & sole argument of intransitive

Early Hick can be described as a language with an ergative-absolutive alignment.
Languages with this alignment treat the "subject" of an intransitive verb like
the "object" of a transitive verb. This "object" or "patient" referent is marked
with the _absolutive_ case marker -es. The "subject" or "agent" referent is
marked with the _ergative_ case marker -el.

```plaintext
materokel 'al-es venitar
handler-ERG person-ABS burden.SUP
"The handler carries the person"
```

In the above example, the handler _materok_ is the agent of the verb "to carry"
and is marked with the ergative case marker -el. The person _'al_ is the patient
of the verb and is marked with the absolutive case marker -es.

```plaintext
'ales barak'er
person-ABS walk-VERB
"The person walks"
```

The single argument of the intransitive verb _barak'er_ is the one performing
the action, but because Early Hick is an ergative-absolutive language, the
absolutive case marker -es is used to mark the referent.

### Development of the Ergative Case Marking -el

The Early Hick ergative marker -el derives from Proto-Hick \*mela through
parallel but distinct development from the definite article:

1. Sound Changes:

   - \*mela > \*mel (final vowel loss)
   - \*mel > -el (initial m-loss in unstressed position)

2. Functional Development:

   - Original meaning: definite animate marker
   - Intermediate stage: marks definite agents
   - Final stage: general ergative marker

## Verbal System

See: [Verbal Morphology](#verbal-morphology) for details on:

Early Hick has no true verb class. Verbs are formed from nouns and property
concepts and are marked with the verbalizer affix _-'er_.

```plaintext
'al'isel ven'er 'ales
person.PROX.ERG yoke.VERB person.ABS
this person carries a person
I am carrying a person
```

The above example shows the word _ven_ that means yoke or burden with the
verbalizer _-er_ affixed to it. It then acts as the verb of the sentence that
means "to carry".

While some words, such as _barak_ "walk", semantically denote actions, the
verbalizer affix _-'er_ is still applied in most instances.

```plaintext
'ales barak'er
person-ABS walk-VERB
"The person walks."
```

## Spatial Case System

(See: [Spatial Case System](#spatial-case-system)

Early Hick uses case marking to modify a word to indicate the direction an
action is performed.

The spatial cases are:

- -las (ILL): "inward, into"
- -imris (ELL): "outward, from"
- -itar (SUPE): "upward, upon"
- -esp (SUB): "under, below"
- -asam (SUBE): "downward, onto"

These spatial cases are typically appended to verbal words to indicate the
direction an action is performed. When used with transitive verbs, the spatial
cases indicate the direction of the action done by the agent, in relation to the
patient.

```plaintext
branum galel belaes rismateres
PAST man-ERG entrance-ILL reed boat-ABS
The man inward-entrance the reed boat.
The man entered the reed boat.
```

The above example shows the man _gal_ entering the boat _rismater_. There is
another way to express this sentence using the spatial case marker, removing the
explicit verbal word _bel_ "entrance".

```plaintext
branum gales rismater-aes
PAST man-ABS reed boat-ILL
The man entered the reed boat.
```

Since the man is moving inward, into the reed boat, and there is no reason to
specify that the man entered through the entrance, the spatial case marker -aes
may be appended to _rismater_ to indicate that the man entered the boat.

## Temporal System

### Tense Marking

See: [Clause Structure and Word Order](#clause-structure-and-word-order)

The basic temporal markers are added to the beginning of a clause to indicate
the time of the action.

| Tense Marker | Meaning  |
| ------------ | -------- |
| branum       | past     |
| branrum      | far past |
| mulsum       | future   |

```plaintext
branum 'ales venitar
PAST person-ABS yoke-SUPE
PAST person lift
"The person lifted."
```

```plaintext
branrum 'ales venitar
FAR PAST person-ABS yoke-SUPE
FAR PAST person lifted
"The person lifted long ago."
```

```plaintext
mulsum 'ales venitar
FUT person-ABS yoke-SUPE
"The person will lift."
```

## Conjunctions

### Additive Coordination

Early Hick uses ru [ru] "and" (< Proto-Hick \*storu "grow") with the particle o
marking coordinated elements:

```plaintext
kor o toren o ru-el
[cow PART horse PART AND]-ERG
"the cow and horse (as agent)"
```

The coordinator can take case marking to show the role of the coordinated
phrase:

- ru-el: coordinated elements as agent
- ru-es: coordinated elements as patient/subject

### Temporal Coordination

Temporal relationships between clauses use specialized coordinators:

- 'aterbran [ʔa.ter.bran] "before" (lit. "what-flow-dawn")
- 'aterimris [ʔa.te.rim.ris] "after" (lit. "what-flow-from")
- 'atertel [ʔa.ter.tel] "until" (lit. "what-flow-end")

Dependent clauses use nominalized verbs:

```plaintext
[kor o toren o] gras'er-es 'aterimris
[cow PART horse PART] graze-ABS after-ELL
"after the cow and horse grazed"
```

Position affects emphasis:

- Initial: sets temporal frame for discourse
- Final: neutral narrative position

### Causal Subordinator

imris [im.ris] "because" < Proto-Hick \*imeru-ris "towards breath/spirit"

- Functions as a subordinator marking causal relationships
- Grammaticalized from Proto-Hick compound of *imeru "breath/spirit" + *ris
  (LAT)
- Maintains ergative-absolutive alignment in both clauses
- Can appear clause-initially or between clauses

### Position and Usage

Conjunctions interact with Early Hick's information structure:

1. Can take case marking to show grammatical roles
2. Initial position emphasizes the relationship
3. Final position gives neutral narrative flow
4. With dependent clauses, verbs take nominal form

Examples:

```plaintext
imris toranes ter'er, 'ales barak'er
SUB   river-ABS flow-VERB person-ABS walk-VERB
"Because the river flows, the person walks"

'ales barak'er imris toranes ter'er
person-ABS walk-VERB SUB river-ABS flow-VERB
"The person walks because the river flows"
```

Note: The same form appears as the ellative case marker -imris, showing parallel
grammaticalization from spatial/directional meaning to both case marking and
subordination.

# Morphology

## Nominal Morphology

### Agentive Marking

1. Primary Marker
   - -ok [ok]: agentive nominalizer (forms agent nouns, both occupational and
     active) Examples:
   - materok "boatman" < mater-ok "vessel-AGENT" (one who works with vessels)
   - wardok "guide" < ward-ok "direct-AGENT" (one who directs)
   - threnok "watcher" < thren-ok "watch-AGENT" (one who watches)

### Size and Intensity Markers

1. Diminutive (li-)

   - Prefix meaning "small, lesser"
   - Examples:
     - limal [li.mal] "small pool, pond"
     - liren [li.ren] "small deer, fawn"
     - lines [li.nes] "small fish, minnow"

2. Augmentative (tor-)
   - Prefix meaning "great, mighty" (from "height, peak")
   - Examples:
     - tornes [tor.nes] "great fish, whale"
     - topel [to.pel] "great bear" (tor-pel → topel, liquid deletion)
     - tomal [to.mal] "great pool, - lake" (tor-mal → tomal, liquid deletion)
3. Speed Augmentative (tor- -sim)
   - Circumfix combining the argumentative tor- with the translative -sim to
     mean a swift change in speed of the action

### Number Marking

1. Plural Prefix (ma-)
   - Basic plural marker
   - Examples:
     - mator [ma.tor] "peaks, heights"
     - makel [ma.kel] "skies"
   - Interacts with case marking: ma-tor-el (PL-height-ERG)

### Adjectival Marking

From its Proto-Hick root \*kasu, with the sense of reflection upon a mirror-like
surface, the prefix _ka-_ was initially used to denote similarity. Over time, it
had applied to a wide range of concepts, becoming a general adjectivizer.

1. Similarity Prefix (ka-)
   - Prefix meaning "like, similar to"
   - Always surfaces as [kə-] due to regular vowel reduction
   - Examples:
     - ka-tor [kə.tor] "hill-like" (smaller than a mountain)
     - ka-mal [kə.mal] "pond-like" (smaller than a lake)
     - ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)
     - Natural Features: kətor "hill-like", kəmal "pond-like"
     - Animals: kəpel "bear-like", kəmer "bird-like"
     - Body Parts: kəbel "mouth-like", kəven "wing-like"
     - Weather: kəbran "storm-like", kəthral "mist-like"
     - Water Movement: kəran "stream-like", kəthrim "wave-like"
     - Plant Growth: kəthir "grass-like", kəbel "vine-like"
     - Sounds: kəmer "bird-like (sound)", kəsak "wolf-like (howl)"
2. Adjectival Suffix (ka-)
   - Extended beyond just similarity, it has since been used to derive more
     metaphorically related concepts beyond a comparative sense. such as:
     - kasul [ka.sul] "energetic" < ka-sul "liver-like"
     - kames [ka.mes] "emotional" < ka-mes "heart-like"
3. Use with Translative -sim When ka- prefixed forms take the translative suffix
   -sim, they indicate becoming like the base noun:

   a. Intransitive use (spontaneous change):

   ```plaintext
   mes-es kames-sim
   heart-ABS heart.like-TRANS
   "The heart becomes emotional" (lit. "becomes heart-like")
   ```

   b. Transitive use (caused change):

   ```plaintext
   sibris-el mes-es kames-sim
   love-ERG heart-ABS heart.like-TRANS
   "Love makes the heart emotional" (lit. "love makes heart become heart-like")

   'al-el sul-es kasul-sim
   person-ERG liver-ABS liver.like-TRANS
   "The person energizes the liver" (lit. "person makes liver become liver-like")
   ```

   Note: In transitive uses, the ergative marks the agent causing the change,
   while the absolutive marks what undergoes the change.

### Demonstrative System

1. Visible/Known
   - -is [is] "this" (inanimate)
   - -ʔis [ʔis] "this" (animate)
   - -en [en] "that" (inanimate)
   - -tan [tan] "that" (animate)
2. Hidden but Sensed
   - -eth [eθ] "this/that" (inanimate)
   - -thir [θir] "this/that" (animate)
3. Distant/Out of Sight
   - -um [um] "that" (inanimate)
   - -rum [rum] "that" (animate)

### Personal Reference

1. Spatial Demonstratives
   - istal "this.place-person" (speaker's location)
   - etal "that.place-person" (addressee's location)
   - utal "far.place-person" (third party location)

### Negation System

1. Basic Negation
   - mo- [mo]: general negation prefix Examples:
     - mo-thral "non-sacred, profane"
     - mo-ter "not flowing, stagnant"
     - mo-ward "misdirect, lead astray"

### Possession Marking

1. Basic Possession
   - -ul [ul]: possessive suffix Examples:
   - mater-ul "vessel owner"
   - thral-ul "ritual keeper"

## Verbal Morphology

### Verbalizer

- -'er ['er]: creates verbs from nouns and property concepts (See:
  [Proto-Hick](@/languages/hick/proto-hick.md#segmental-inventory))
- If -'er is preceded by a plosive, it surfaces as [er]

```plaintext
mulis-'er [mulis.ʔer] "dreaminɡ"
tak-er [tak.er] "strike"
```

1. Active verbs (from action/motion concepts):

   ```plaintext
   ai-es ter-'er
   water-ABS flow-VERB
   "Water flows"

   materok-el 'al-es ward-'er
   handler-ERG person-ABS guide-VERB
   "The handler guides the person"
   ```

   Examples:

   - ter-'er "to flow" (See:
     [Water Features](@/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md#water-features))
   - thren-'er "to watch" (See:
     [Sacred Terms](@/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md#sacred--ritual))
   - ward-'er "to guide"

2. Stative verbs (from property concepts):

   ```plaintext
   tor-thir-es thral-'er
   peak-KNOWN.ANIM-ABS sacred-VERB
   "The known peak is sacred"

   kel-es mar-'er
   sky-ABS red-VERB
   "The sky is red"
   ```

   Examples:

   - thral-'er "to be sacred" (See:
     [Sacred Terms](@/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md#sacred--ritual))
   - mar-'er "to be red" (See:
     [Colors](@/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md#colors))

Note: Interpretation depends on base word semantics:

- Action/motion roots → active verbs (ter "flow", ward "guide")
- Property roots → stative verbs (thral "sacred") (See:
  [Basic Terms](@/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md#basic-terms))

## Volitional Marker

- **-arm**: Indicates volitional mood, suggesting intention or willingness to
  perform an action.

The -arm suffix replaces the -'er suffix in volitional contexts.

### Usage Example

- **sinasarm**: "let's play" or "let's drift" < sinas-arm "play-VOLITION" →
  sinasarm

This suffix allows speakers to express a desire or suggestion to perform an
action, similar to the volitional mood in other languages.

## Desiderative Marker

- **-nat**: Indicates desire or want to perform an action
- Grammaticalized from full verb gnater "desire"
- Replaces -'er suffix in desiderative contexts

### Usage Examples

```plaintext
'ales vennat
person-ABS carry-DESID
"The person wants to carry"
materok-el rismater-es wardnat
handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide-DESID
"The handler wants to guide the reed boat"
```

Note: Shows semantic development from full verb gnater "desire" to
grammaticalized suffix through phonological reduction. Maintains
ergative-absolutive alignment of main clause. ci

## Spatial Case System

Early Hick's spatial case system interacts closely with verbal semantics,
marking not only physical direction but also abstract state changes and
causation.

1. Basic Spatial Cases

   - -las (ILL): "inward, into"
   - -imris (ELL): "outward, from"
   - -itar (SUPE): "upward, upon"
   - -asam (SUBE): "downward, onto"
   - -esp (SUB): "under, below"

2. Directional Usage

   ```plaintext
   materok-el rismater-las
   handler-ERG reed.boat-ILL
   "The handler enters the reed boat"

   materok-el rismater-imris
   handler-ERG reed.boat-ELL
   "The handler exits the reed boat"

   materok-el rismater-itar
   handler-ERG reed.boat-SUPE
   "The handler climbs onto the reed boat"

   materok-el rismater-asam
   handler-ERG reed.boat-SUBE
   "The handler climbs down from the reed boat"
   ```

3. Change of State

   - Spatial cases extend to mark state changes
   - See: [Adjectival System](#adjectival-morphology) for full details

   ```plaintext
   kamar kel-es kakel-las
   red sky-ABS blue-ILL
   "red sky turns blue"
   ```

4. Syntactic Properties
   - Supplants ergative case in motion contexts
   - Can be fronted for emphasis
   - Implies motion/change without overt verb
   - Interacts with causative constructions

## Adjectival Morphology

Early Hick has no true adjective class. Quality concepts are expressed through:

1. Stative Verbs (See: [Verbal Morphology](#verbal-morphology))

   - Uses verbalizer -ʔer
   - Takes absolutive argument Examples:

   ```plaintext
   kel-es kakel-ʔer
   sky-ABS blue-VERB
   "The sky is blue"

   thral-el kel-es kakel-ʔer
   ritual-ERG sky-ABS blue-VERB
   "The ritual makes the sky blue"
   ```

2. Change of State

   1. Translative (-sim):

      ```plaintext
      kel-es kakel-sim
      sky.ABS blue.TRANS
      "sky becomes blue"
      ```

   2. Directional Cases (-las/-imris):

      ```plaintext
      kamar kel-es kakel-las
      red sky-ABS blue-ILL
      "red sky turns blue"
      ```

3. Notes:
   - No attributive modification
   - All qualities are verbal predicates
   - Follows ergative-absolutive alignment
   - Causatives marked by adding ergative agent

## Derivational Morphology

### Similarity Prefix

- ka- [kə]: prefix meaning "like, similar to"
- Always surfaces as [kə-] due to regular vowel reduction Examples:
- ka-tor [kə.tor] "hill-like" (smaller than a mountain)
- ka-mal [kə.mal] "pond-like" (smaller than a lake)
- ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)

### Negation System

- mo- [mo]: general negation prefix Examples:
- mo-thral "non-sacred, profane"
- mo-ter "not flowing, stagnant"
- mo-ward "misdirect, lead astray"

### Compound Formation

- Basic Pattern: modifier-head
- Sound changes:
  - Liquid deletion: tor-mal → tomal
  - Nasal deletion: bram-mal → bramal Examples:
- kur-tin → kurtin "bronze" (copper-tin)
- bram-mater → brammater "river vessel" (tide-vessel)
- thral-kel → thrakel "sun" (sacred-sky)

### Body Metaphors

1. Breath as the soul
2. Liver as source of life
3. Heart as source of emotion
4. Bones as structure
5. Hands as tools
6. Eyes as reality
7. Skin as appearance
8. Skin, Hair as abstract senses

## Affix Order

### Basic Template

1. Root Structure

   - (PREFIX*) + ROOT + (SUFFIX*)
   - Maximum of three prefixes and two suffixes

2. Order of Elements

```plaintext
(NEG)-(SIZE)-(SIM)-ROOT-(AGENT)-(CASE)

```

Examples:

- mo-tor-el (NEG-height-ERG) "not the height (as agent)"
- li-ka-mal-ok-es (DIM-SIM-pool-AGENT-ABS) "small pool-like keeper (as patient)"
- tor-ka-mal-el (AUG-SIM-pool-ERG) "great pool-like thing (as agent)"

### Prefix Classes

1. Outer Prefixes (first position)
   - mo- (NEG): negation
   - ma- (PL): plural
2. Middle Prefixes (second position)
   - tor- (AUG): augmentative
   - li- (DIM): diminutive
3. Inner Prefixes (closest to root)
   - ka- (SIM): similarity
   - is- (PROX): proximate
   - eth- (MED): medial
   - um- (DIST): distal

### Suffix Classes

1. Inner Suffixes (closer to root)

   - -ok (AGENT): agentive
   - -er (ACT): active participant

2. Outer Suffixes (final position)
   - -el (ERG): ergative case
   - -es (ABS): absolutive case
   - -imris (ELL): ellative case
   - -aes (ILL): illative case

### Restrictions

1. Co-occurrence

   - Only one prefix from each position class
   - Maximum of one case suffix
   - Agent suffix must precede case suffix

2. Phonological Interactions
   - Prefix ka- always reduces to [kə-]
   - Liquid deletion applies across morpheme boundaries
   - Nasal deletion applies across morpheme boundaries

# Syntax

## Property Words and Modification

Early Hick uses property words (like English adjectives and adverbs) in three
main ways:

1. As Adjectives (modifying nouns)

   - Come before the noun they modify

   ```plaintext
   'irek litor-es etal
   firm hill-ABS that.MED
   "that firm hill" (like English "the tall tree")
   ```

2. As Predicate Adjectives (with verb marking)

   ```plaintext
   litor-es 'irek'er
   hill-ABS firm-VERB
   "The hill is firm" (like English "The tree is tall")
   ```

3. As Adverbs (modifying verbs)
   - Come after the verb they modify
   - Often take the similarity prefix ka-
   ```plaintext
   wen'altanes 'irek'er ka'irek
   woman.MED.VIS.ANIM-ABS stand-VERB firm-SIM
   "She stands firmly" (like English "-ly" adverbs)
   ```

This pattern means that word order shows whether a property word is acting like
an adjective (before nouns) or an adverb (after verbs).

## Clause Structure and Word Order

1. Basic Patterns

   - Core arguments marked by case, allowing flexible word order
   - Ergative (-el) marks agent of transitive verbs
   - Absolutive (-es) marks patient of transitive & sole argument of
     intransitive
   - Word order signals pragmatic functions rather than grammatical roles

2. Information Structure

   - Initial position: topic/focus or temporal frame
   - Final position: new information or emphasis
   - Examples:

     ```plaintext
     branum bramisimris kethes
     past    river-ELL    sea-ABS
     "In the past, the river flowed to the sea" (temporal frame first)

     kethes bramisimris branum
     sea-ABS river-ELL    past
     "The river flowed to the sea, in the past" (neutral statement)
     ```

3. Verb Position and Aspect

   - Verbs can occur in different positions based on aspect:

     ```plaintext
     materok-el rismater-es ward tel
     handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide COMPL
     "The handler has guided the reed boat" (completed action)

     rismater-es ward kethes
     reed.boat-ABS guide sea-ABS
     "The reed boat guides to sea" (general statement)
     ```

   - Directional constructions allow goal prominence:
     ```plaintext
     keth-aes materok-el rismater-es
     sea-ILL  handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS
     "To sea the handler (takes) the reed boat"
     ```

4. Temporal Reference

   - Time words can float freely but tend toward:
     - Initial: setting temporal frame for discourse
     - Pre-verbal: marking temporal contrast
     - Final: neutral narrative position
   - Examples:

     ```plaintext
     branum materok-el ward-ʔer  # Frame-setting
     past    handler-ERG guide-VERB
     "In the past, the handler guided"

     materok-el branum ward-ʔer  # Temporal contrast
     handler-ERG past    guide-ACT
     "The handler USED TO guide"

     materok-el ward-ʔer branum  # Neutral narrative
     handler-ERG guide-ACT past
     "The handler guided, in the past"
     ```

See: [Tense and Aspect](#tense-and-aspect) for a complete description of:

- Past reference markers (branum, branrum)
- Future reference (mulsum)
- Completive aspect (tel)
- Position effects on temporal interpretation

## Tense and Aspect

1. Past Reference

   ```plaintext
   branum materok-el ward-'er
   past   handler-ERG guide-VERB
   "The handler guided (in the past)"
   ```

   - branum [bra.num] "past" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.INAN")
     - General past reference and narratives
   - branrum [bran.rum] "ancestral time" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.ANIM")
     - Sacred histories and ancestral stories
   - Position affects meaning:

     ```plaintext
     branum bramisimris kethes
     past   river-ELL    sea-ABS
     "In the past, the river flowed to the sea" (temporal frame)

     bramisimris branum kethes
     river-ELL   past   sea-ABS
     "The river USED TO flow to the sea" (emphasis)
     ```

2. Future Reference

   ```plaintext
   mulsum materok-el ward-'er
   future handler-ERG guide-VERB
   "The handler will guide"
   ```

   - mulsum [mul.sum] "future" (lit. "night-change-DIST")
     - Used for both predictions and intentions

3. Completive Aspect

   ```plaintext
   materok-el rismater-es ward tel
   handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide COMPL
   "The handler has guided the reed boat"
   ```

   - tel [tel] "complete, finished"
   - Always follows main clause

## Interrogatives

1. Basic Forms

   - 'alis [ʔa.lis] "who" < 'aka-'al-is (what-person-PROX.ANIM)
     - Used for visible/known referents and confirmation
   - 'atal [ʔa.tal] "where" < 'aka-tal-is (what-place-PROX.INAN)
   - 'ater [ʔa.ter] "when" < 'aka-ter-is (what-flow-PROX.INAN)
     - Shows temporal metaphor of time as flow
   - 'aker [ʔa.ker] "how" < 'aka-'er-is (what-VERB-PROX.INAN)

2. Medial Forms (Hidden but Sensed)

   - 'aleth [ʔa.leθ] < 'aka-'al-eth "who" (sensed person)
   - 'ateth [ʔa.teθ] < 'aka-tal-eth "where" (sensed location)
   - 'atereth [ʔe.te.leθ] < 'aka-ter-eth "when" (sensed time)
   - 'akereth [ʔa.ke.reθ] < 'aka-'er-eth "how" (sensed manner)

3. Distal Forms (Out of Sight/Unknown)

   - 'alum [ʔa.lum] < 'aka-'al-um "who" (unknown person)
   - 'atum [ʔa.tum] < 'aka-tal-um "where" (unknown location)
   - 'aterum [ʔa.te.rum] < 'aka-ter-um "when" (unknown time)
   - 'akerum [ʔa.ke.rum] < 'aka-'er-um "how" (unknown manner)

4. Usage Examples

   ```plaintext
   'alis-el materok-es ward-'er?
   who.PROX-ERG boat-ABS guide-VERB
   "Who (that we can see) guides the boat?"

   'aleth-el thral-es his-'er?
   who.MED-ERG ritual-ABS watch-VERB
   "Who (that we can hear/sense) watches the ritual?"

   'atum-aes materok-el rismater-es ward-'er?
   where.DIST-ILL handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide-VERB
   "Where (unknown) does the handler guide the reed boat to?"
   ```

5. Semantic Notes

   - Proximal forms: Used for visible/known referents and confirmation
   - Medial forms: Used for sensed but not seen referents (sounds, smells, etc.)
   - Distal forms: Default information-seeking questions about unknowns
   - All forms take regular case marking based on syntactic role
   - Follow standard compound phonology (See:
     [Compound Phonology](#compound-phonology))

See: [Compound Phonology](#compound-phonology) for sound change patterns

## Relative Clauses

Early Hick forms relative clauses using interrogative pronouns as relativizers.
These maintain their proximal/medial/distal distinctions and take case marking
based on their syntactic role within the relative clause.

1. Basic Structure

   ```plaintext
   ['alisel tiraies ter'er] barak'erimris vinudes
   [who.ERG ale.ABS drink.VERB] walk.VERB-ELL dwelling.ABS
   "Who drinks the ale walks home"
   ```

2. Interrogative Forms Used

   - 'alis/aleth/alum: "who" (animate referents)
   - 'atal/ateth/atum: "where" (locations)
   - 'atel/ateleth/atelum: "when" (time)
   - 'aker/akereth/akerum: "how" (manner)

3. Case Marking

   - Relativizer takes case based on its role in the relative clause
   - Main clause maintains independent case marking

   ```plaintext
   'altanel ['alises thren'er] ward'er
   man-MED.VIS.ANIM [who.ABS watch.VERB] guide.VERB
   "That man who watches guides"
   ```

4. Evidentiality Through Distance Forms

   - Proximal (-is): visible/known referents
   - Medial (-eth): sensed but not seen referents
   - Distal (-um): unknown/general referents

   ```plaintext
   ['alumel materokes ward'er] thren'er
   [who.DIST.ERG boat.ABS guide.VERB] watch.VERB
   "Who(ever) guides the boat watches"
   ```

5. Word Order
   - Relative clause typically precedes its head
   - Internal word order follows main clause patterns
   - Spatial case marking on verbs functions normally

# Development Notes

## Development Notes

### Case Development

#### Superessive (-itar)

The Early Hick superessive marker -itar derives from Proto-Hick \*ʔita haranu
"above the break/horizon":

1. Initial compound: \*ʔita haranu "above horizon"
2. Fusion and reduction: > \*ʔitharan
3. Grammaticalization: > -itar
   - Loss of final nasal
   - Semantic broadening from "above horizon" to general "upon/above"
   - Shift from independent word to bound morpheme

#### Ellative (-imris)

The Early Hick ellative marker -imris derives from Proto-Hick \*imeru-ris
"towards breath/spirit":

1. Initial compound: \*imeru-ris "towards breath"
2. Fusion and reduction: > \*imeris
3. Nasal epenthesis: > -imris
   - Semantic shift from "towards breath" to "outward motion"
   - Parallel development as subordinator "because"
   - Shows common path: body/breath terms → spatial/causal markers

#### Subessive (-asam)

The Early Hick subessive marker -asam derives from the noun asam "rest, resting
place" < PH \*xasamu:

1. Original noun: "rest, resting place"
2. Metaphorical extension: "place beneath/under"
3. Grammaticalization: > -asam
   - Semantic broadening from "resting place" to general "under/beneath"
   - Shift from independent noun to bound case marker
   - Shows common path: concrete spatial term → abstract case marker
   - Parallel development in compound vinusam "shoulder" (< \*vinu xasamu "yoke
     rest")
   - Maintains unstressed vowel reduction in both uses
