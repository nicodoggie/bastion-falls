# Overview

The Hick language was the primary tongue of pre-Kalassarian Senera. While no
longer spoken, it survives in place names, maritime terminology, and religious
traditions throughout modern Senera.

A Kalassarian language grammatical sketch of Early and Middle Hick was
unearthed, along with a lexicon was found in an unsealed room underneath the
[Admiralty's Helm](@/locations/admiraltys-helm.md) in
[Surrey-on-the-Brams](@/locations/surrey-on-the-brams.md). Details in this is a
modern analysis of that sketch using modern linguistic methods.

A reconstruction of a hypothetical Proto-Hick is also provided, inferenced from
regional dialects and the historical development of Hick.

# Historical Development

## Early Hick (prehistory to ~300 PF)

- Purely oral tradition
- Core maritime and nature vocabulary established
- Complex compound system develops
- Sacred/ritual terminology crystallizes

## Middle Hick (300 PF to 105 AI)

- More consistent contact with pre-Kalassarian traders
- Maritime trade vocabulary expansion
- Astronomical terminology development
- Sacred site naming conventions formalize
- Initial written forms appear (borrowed script)

## Late Hick/Early Seneran (105 AI to 400 AI)

- Kalassarian settlement period begins
- Administrative terminology adoption
- Initial sound changes:
  - Unstressed vowel reduction begins
  - Compound simplification starts
  - Some liquid deletion word-internally

## Middle Seneran (400 AI to 900 AI)

- Major sound changes:
  - Full unstressed vowel reduction
  - Resyllabification for CV preference
  - Systematic liquid/nasal deletion
  - Stress-related vowel lengthening
- Example: [in.nes.bel] → [i.ne.spel]

## Modern Seneran (900 AI to present)

- Extensive contact with Apgarian kingdoms
- Final changes:
  - Complete syllable restructuring
  - Final cluster simplification
  - Vowel length phonemicization
- Example: [i.ne.spel] → [ine.spell]

## Overview

Early Hick shows a relatively conservative phonological system inherited from
Proto-Hick, with significant changes occurring mainly in compound formation and
unstressed syllables. See: [Historical Development](#historical-development)

See: [Sound Changes in Compounds](@/languages/hick/early-hick/compounds.md)

### Vowel Sequences

1. Permitted Diphthongs:

   - Within morphemes: /ai/, /ei/, /ae/
   - At morpheme boundaries:
     - /ei-ae/ → [e.e]
     - /ai-ae/ → [ae]
   - No three-vowel sequences

2. Examples:
   - /kei-aes/ → [ke.es] "sky flow"
   - /thrai-aes/ → [thraes] "sacred flow"
   - /brai-aes/ → [braes] "swift flow"

### Weight Distribution Constraints

1. Stress Patterns

   - Primary stress falls on first syllable of simple words
   - In compounds:
     - a. First element maintains primary stress
     - b. Second element reduces unless sacred/ritual term
     - c. Three-element compounds:
       - Primary stress on first element
       - Secondary stress on final element
       - Middle element reduces
   - Exceptions:
     - Sacred/ritual terms resist reduction
     - Maritime terms maintain second element weight
     - Recent compounds may preserve full weight
     - Morphological boundaries may preserve weight

   Examples:

   - tor-mal → [ˈto.məl] "great pool"
   - thral-kel → [ˈθral.kel] "sacred sky" (no reduction - sacred term)
   - tor-ma-ter → [ˈtor.mə.ˌter] "great-pool-flow"
   - bram-ma-ter → [ˈbram.ma.ˌter] "tide-vessel" (no reduction - maritime)

## Prosodic System

### Stress Patterns

1. Primary Stress
   - Falls on first syllable of root in isolation
   - Maintained in prefixation: ma-tor → [ˈma.tor]
   - Shifts in compounds: tor-mal → [tor.ˈmal]
2. Secondary Stress
   - In three-syllable compounds: tor-ma-ter → [ˈtor.mə.ˌter]
   - In prefix chains: ma-ka-tor → [ˈma.kə.ˌtor]
3. Stress-Related Changes
   - Unstressed /a/ → [ə]
   - Stressed vowels resist reduction
   - Compound stress affects vowel quality

## Compound Phonology

### Sound Changes in Compounds

1. Liquid Deletion

   - tor-mal → tomal "lake"
   - val-mal → vamal "spirit pool"
   - thral-gral → thragral "sacred earth"

2. Nasal Deletion

   - bram-mal → bramal "tidal pool"
   - bran-kel → brakel "morning sky"

3. Vowel Coalescence
   - kei-aes → kees "sky flow"
   - thrai-aes → thraes "sacred flow"

### Compound Types

1. Element + Element

   - kur-tin → kurtin "bronze" (copper-tin)
   - mal-ter → mater "stream" (pool-flow)

2. Descriptor + Element
   - gra-kur → grakur "grey copper"
   - tor-mal → tomal "great pool"

## Allophonic Rules

### Vowel Allophony

The vowel /a/ surfaces as [ə]:

1. After sibilants and affricates:

   - /sak/ → [sək] "wolf"
   - /sal/ → [səl] "stone"

2. After voiceless stops in unstressed syllables:

   - /karan/ → [kərən] "stream"
   - /tamal/ → [təmal] "pool-like"

3. In grammatical prefixes:

   - /ka-/ → [kə-] (similarity prefix)
   - /ma-/ → [mə-] (plural prefix) See:
     [Morphological Prefixes](@/languages/hick/early-hick/morphology.md#prefixes)

4. Between identical consonants:
   - /malam/ → [məlam] "pooled"
   - /ranar/ → [rənər] "flowing"

#### Stress-Dependent Reduction

1. In Compounds:

   - First element maintains stress: 'tor-mal → ['tor.məl]
   - Second element reduced: mal-'ter → [məl.'ter]

2. With Prefixes:

   - Stressed prefix blocks reduction: 'ma-tor → ['ma.tor]
   - Unstressed prefix shows reduction: ka-'tor → [kə.'tor]

3. In Three-syllable Words:
   - Primary stress blocks reduction: 'ka-ra-nal → ['ka.rə.nəl]
   - Secondary stress partially blocks: ˌka-'ra-nal → [ˌka.'ra.nəl]

#### Exceptions

- Maintains [a] in:
  - Stressed syllables
  - Sacred/formal terms
  - Recent compounds See:
    [Sacred Terminology](@/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md#sacred--ritual)

# Morphology

## Overview

Early Hick shows an ergative-absolutive alignment with rich derivational
morphology and a sophisticated spatial reference system. Core grammatical
relations are marked through suffixes, while derivational processes primarily
use prefixes.

## Core Grammar

### Case System

1. Primary Cases

   - -el [el] (ERG): marks agent of transitive verbs
   - -es [es] (ABS): marks patient of transitive & sole argument of intransitive

   Examples:

   ```plaintext
   materok-el ʔal-es ward-ter
   handler-ERG person-ABS direct-to
   "The handler directs the person"

   ʔal-es ter-ʔer
   person-ABS move-ACT
   "The person moves"
   ```

2. Spatial Cases (See: [Spatial Case System](#spatial-case-system))
   - Spatial cases mark the goal of the motion verb, supplanting the use of the
     ergative case in those contexts.
     - -aes (ILL): "inward, into"
     - -imris (ELL): "outward, from"
     - -itar (SUPE): "upward, upon"
     - -esp (SUB): "under, below"
     - -asam (SUBE): "downward, onto"

### Agentive Marking

1. Primary Marker
   - -ok [ok]: agentive nominalizer (forms agent nouns, both occupational and
     active) Examples:
   - materok "boatman" < mater-ok "vessel-AGENT" (one who works with vessels)
   - wardok "guide" < ward-ok "direct-AGENT" (one who directs)
   - threnok "watcher" < thren-ok "watch-AGENT" (one who watches)

[Note: The -er suffix appears in Middle Hick through Old Iutlandish
contact, leading to the occupational/active distinction between -ok/-er in Late Hick]

### Tense and Aspect Marking

1. Basic Temporal Markers

   - branum [bra.num] "past" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.INAN")
     - From bran "dawn" + -um "distal inanimate"
     - Conceptualizes past as distant dawn-time, reflecting Hick cultural view
       of time flowing from dawn to night
     - Used for general past reference and historical narratives
   - branrum [bran.rum] "ancestral time" (lit. "dawn-that.DIST.ANIM")
     - Uses animate distal marker -rum to personify ancestral time
     - Specifically used for sacred histories and ancestral stories
     - Contrasts with branum by marking time as animate/sacred
   - mulsum [mul.sum] "future" (lit. "night-change-DIST")
     - From mulsimrum "changes to a distant night"
     - Grammaticalized through reduction: mulsimrum → mulsum
     - Reflects Hick metaphor of future as approaching darkness
     - Used for both predictions and intentions

2. Completive Marking

   - tel [tel] "complete, finished"
     - Follows clause for past perfect meaning
     - Derives from Proto-Hick \*telu "place/position"
     - Metaphorical extension: reaching a place → completion
     - Example: bramisimris kethes branum tel "the river had flowed to the sea"

3. Position and Usage

   - Sentence-initial (topic/focus):
     - Marks temporal frame for entire discourse
     - Often used in formal/ritual speech
     - Example: branum bramisimris kethes "In the past, the river flowed to the
       sea"
   - Sentence-final (neutral):
     - Default narrative position
     - Most common in everyday speech
     - Example: bramisimris kethes branum "The river flowed to the sea"
   - Pre-verbal (emphasis):
     - Marks temporal contrast
     - Used for emphasis or correction
     - Example: bramisimris branum kethes "The river USED TO flow to sea"

### Spatial Reference System

1. Basic Spatial Markers

   - ran (archaic locative): "at, in"
   - ris (archaic locative): "from, away" Examples:
   - is-ran "at this place"
   - eth-ran "at that place"
   - um-ris "away from that place"

2. Spatial Demonstratives
   - istel-ʔal "this.place-person" (speaker's location)
   - ethtel-ʔal "that.place-person" (addressee's location)
   - umtel-ʔal "far.place-person" (third party location)

### Conjunctions

1. Basic Connectors

   - is "and" (sequential)
   - eth "and" (simultaneous)
   - um "or"

2. Complex Connectors
   - ishis [is.his] "and then"
   - ethis [eθ.is] "while"
   - umis [um.is] "or else"

### Verbal System

1. Basic Verbalizer
   - -ʔer [ʔer]: creates active verbs Examples:
   - ter-ʔer "to flow" (flow-ACT)
   - thral-ʔer "to be sacred" (sacred-ACT)
   - thren-ʔer "to watch" (watch-ACT)

### Spatial Case System

Early Hick's directional system marks the goal of the motion verb, supplanting
the use of the ergative case in those contexts.

1. Basic Directionals
   - -aes: illative "inward, into"
   - -imris: ellative "outward, from"
   - -itar: superessive "upward, upon"
   - -asam: subessive "downward, onto"
   - -esp: sublative "under, below"
   - -sim: translative "change of state, become"
   - Examples:
     - keth-aes "into the sea"
     - keth-imris "from the sea"
     - tor-itar "upward to the peak"
     - tor-asam "downward from the peak"
2. Complex Directionals
   - -aes-imris: translative "change of state, become"
     - formal, reduced to shorter -sim

## Nominal Morphology

### Size and Intensity Markers

1. Diminutive (li-)

   - Prefix meaning "small, lesser"
   - Examples:
     - limal [li.mal] "small pool, pond"
     - liren [li.ren] "small deer, fawn"
     - lines [li.nes] "small fish, minnow"

2. Augmentative (tor-)
   - Prefix meaning "great, mighty" (from "height, peak")
   - Examples:
     - tornes [tor.nes] "great fish, whale"
     - topel [to.pel] "great bear" (tor-pel → topel, liquid deletion)
     - tomal [to.mal] "great pool, lake" (tor-mal → tomal, liquid deletion)
3. Speed Augmentative (tor- -sim)
   - Circumfix combining the argumentative tor- with the translative -sim to
     mean a swift change in speed

### Number Marking

1. Plural Prefix (ma-)
   - Basic plural marker
   - Examples:
     - mator [ma.tor] "peaks, heights"
     - makel [ma.kel] "skies"
   - Interacts with case marking: ma-tor-el (PL-height-ERG)

### Similarity Marking

1. Similarity Prefix (ka-)
   - Prefix meaning "like, similar to"
   - Always surfaces as [kə-] due to regular vowel reduction
   - Examples:
     - ka-tor [kə.tor] "hill-like" (smaller than a mountain)
     - ka-mal [kə.mal] "pond-like" (smaller than a lake)
     - ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)
2. Usage Domains
   - Natural Features: kətor "hill-like", kəmal "pond-like"
   - Animals: kəpel "bear-like", kəmer "bird-like"
   - Body Parts: kəbel "mouth-like", kəven "wing-like"
   - Weather: kəbran "storm-like", kəthral "mist-like"
   - Water Movement: kəran "stream-like", kəthrim "wave-like"
   - Plant Growth: kəthir "grass-like", kəbel "vine-like"
   - Sounds: kəmer "bird-like (sound)", kəsak "wolf-like (howl)"

### Demonstrative System

1. Visible/Known
   - -is [is] "this" (inanimate)
   - -ʔis [ʔis] "this" (animate)
   - -en [en] "that" (inanimate)
   - -tan [tan] "that" (animate)
2. Hidden but Sensed
   - -eth [eθ] "this/that" (inanimate)
   - -thir [θir] "this/that" (animate)
3. Distant/Out of Sight
   - -um [um] "that" (inanimate)
   - -rum [rum] "that" (animate)

### Personal Reference

1. Spatial Demonstratives
   - istel-ʔal "this.place-person" (speaker's location)
   - ethtel-ʔal "that.place-person" (addressee's location)
   - umtel-ʔal "far.place-person" (third party location)

### Negation System

1. Basic Negation
   - mo- [mo]: general negation prefix Examples:
     - mo-thral "non-sacred, profane"
     - mo-ter "not flowing, stagnant"
     - mo-ward "misdirect, lead astray"

### Possession Marking

1. Basic Possession
   - -ok [ok]: possessive suffix Examples:
   - mater-ok "vessel owner"
   - thral-ok "ritual keeper"

## Verbal Morphology

### Verbalizer

- -ʔer [ʔer]: creates active verbs Examples:
- ter-ʔer "to flow" (flow-ACT)
- thral-ʔer "to be sacred" (sacred-ACT)
- thren-ʔer "to watch" (watch-ACT)

### Directional System

1. Basic Directionals

   - -aes: illative "inward, into"
   - -imris: ellative "outward, from"
   - -itar: superlative "upward"
   - -asam: sublative "downward"

2. Example Usage

   - materokel rismateraes "the boatman enters the reed boat"
   - materokel rismaterimris "the boatman exits the reed boat"
   - materokel rismateritar "the boatman climbs onto the reed boat"
   - materokel rismaterasam "the boatman climbs down from the reed boat"

3. Notes:
   - Directional cases imply motion verbs
   - Ergative (-el) marks the agent
   - No additional case marking needed on the goal/source when using
     directionals

## Adjectival Morphology

Early Hick has no true adjective class. Quality concepts are expressed through:

1. Stative Verbs

   - Uses verbalizer -ʔer
   - Takes absolutive argument Examples:
   - kel-es kakel'er "sky-ABS blue.VERB" (the sky is blue)
   - thral-el kel-es kakel'er "ritual-ERG sky-ABS blue.VERB" (the ritual makes
     the sky blue)

2. Change of State

   1. Translative (-sim): keles kakelsim sky.ABS blue.TRANS "sky becomes blue"
      (general change of state)

      thralel kakelsim keles ritual.ERG blue.TRANS sky.ABS "ritual makes sky
      blue" (caused change)

   2. Directional Cases (-aes/-imris): kamar keles kakelaes red sky.ABS blue.ILL
      "red sky turns blue" (movement toward state)

      kakel keles kamarimris blue sky.ABS red.ELL "blue sky turns back red"
      (return to state)

3. Notes:
   - No attributive modification
   - All qualities are verbal predicates
   - Follows ergative-absolutive alignment
   - Causatives marked by adding ergative agent

## Derivational Morphology

- ka- [kə]: prefix meaning "like, similar to"
- Always surfaces as [kə-] due to regular vowel reduction Examples:
- ka-tor [kə.tor] "hill-like" (smaller than a mountain)

- kur-tin → kurtin "bronze" (copper-tin)
- bram-mater → brammater "river vessel" (tide-vessel)
- thral-kel → thrakel "sun" (sacred-sky)

### Body Metaphors

1. Breath as the soul
2. Liver as source of life
3. Heart as source of emotion
4. Bones as structure
5. Hands as tools
6. Eyes as reality
7. Skin as appearance

- -ʔer [ʔer]: creates active verbs Examples:
- ter-ʔer "to flow" (flow-ACT)
- thral-ʔer "to be sacred" (sacred-ACT)
- thren-ʔer "to watch" (watch-ACT)

### Directional System

1. Basic Directionals

   - -aes: illative "inward, into"
   - -imris: ellative "outward, from"
   - -itar: superlative "upward"
   - -asam: sublative "downward"

2. Example Usage

   - materokel rismateraes "the boatman enters the reed boat"
   - materokel rismaterimris "the boatman exits the reed boat"
   - materokel rismateritar "the boatman climbs onto the reed boat"
   - materokel rismaterasam "the boatman climbs down from the reed boat"

3. Notes:
   - Directional cases imply motion verbs
   - Ergative (-el) marks the agent
   - No additional case marking needed on the goal/source when using
     directionals

## Derivational Morphology

### Similarity Prefix

- ka- [kə]: prefix meaning "like, similar to"
- Always surfaces as [kə-] due to regular vowel reduction Examples:
- ka-tor [kə.tor] "hill-like" (smaller than a mountain)
- ka-mal [kə.mal] "pond-like" (smaller than a lake)
- ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)

### Negation System

- mo- [mo]: general negation prefix Examples:
- mo-thral "non-sacred, profane"
- mo-ter "not flowing, stagnant"
- mo-ward "misdirect, lead astray"

### Compound Formation

- Basic Pattern: modifier-head
- Sound changes:
  - Liquid deletion: tor-mal → tomal
  - Nasal deletion: bram-mal → bramal Examples:
- kur-tin → kurtin "bronze" (copper-tin)
- bram-mater → brammater "river vessel" (tide-vessel)
- thral-kel → thrakel "sun" (sacred-sky)

### Body Metaphors

1. Breath as the soul
2. Liver as source of life
3. Heart as source of emotion
4. Bones as structure
5. Hands as tools
6. Eyes as reality
7. Skin as appearance

## Affix Order

### Basic Template

1. Root Structure

   - (PREFIX*) + ROOT + (SUFFIX*)
   - Maximum of three prefixes and two suffixes

2. Order of Elements

```plaintext
(NEG)-(SIZE)-(SIM)-ROOT-(AGENT)-(CASE)

```

Examples:

- mo-tor-el (NEG-height-ERG) "not the height (as agent)"
- li-ka-mal-ok-es (DIM-SIM-pool-AGENT-ABS) "small pool-like keeper (as patient)"
- tor-ka-mal-el (AUG-SIM-pool-ERG) "great pool-like thing (as agent)"

### Prefix Classes

1. Outer Prefixes (first position)
   - mo- (NEG): negation
   - ma- (PL): plural
2. Middle Prefixes (second position)
   - tor- (AUG): augmentative
   - li- (DIM): diminutive
3. Inner Prefixes (closest to root)
   - ka- (SIM): similarity
   - is- (PROX): proximate
   - eth- (MED): medial
   - um- (DIST): distal

### Suffix Classes

1. Inner Suffixes (closer to root)

   - -ok (AGENT): agentive
   - -er (ACT): active participant

2. Outer Suffixes (final position)
   - -el (ERG): ergative case
   - -es (ABS): absolutive case
   - -imris (ELL): ellative case
   - -aes (ILL): illative case

### Restrictions

1. Co-occurrence

   - Only one prefix from each position class
   - Maximum of one case suffix
   - Agent suffix must precede case suffix

2. Phonological Interactions
   - Prefix ka- always reduces to [kə-]
   - Liquid deletion applies across morpheme boundaries
   - Nasal deletion applies across morpheme boundaries
