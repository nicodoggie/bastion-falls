# Overview

The Hick language was the primary tongue of pre-Kalassarian Senera. While no
longer spoken, it survives in place names, maritime terminology, and religious
traditions throughout modern Senera.

A Kalassarian language grammatical sketch of Early and Middle Hick was
unearthed, along with a lexicon was found in an unsealed room underneath the
[Admiralty's Helm](@/locations/admiraltys-helm.md) in
[Surrey-on-the-Brams](@/locations/surrey-on-the-brams.md). Details in this is a
modern analysis of that sketch using modern linguistic methods.

Early Hick shows an ergative-absolutive alignment with rich derivational
morphology and a sophisticated spatial reference system. Core grammatical
relations are marked through suffixes, while derivational processes primarily
use prefixes.

A reconstruction of a hypothetical Proto-Hick is also provided, inferenced from
regional dialects and the historical development of Hick.

# Historical Development

## Pre-Hick Period (before ~600 PF)

While the exact developments remain unclear, comparison of Early Hick forms with
remnant vocabulary suggests several possible sound changes:

1. Final vowels begin devoicing in unstressed syllables

   - \*thralu > [ˈθra.lu̥]
   - \*wardu > [ˈwar.du̥]
   - \*taku > [ˈta.ku̥]

2. Devoiced vowels reduce to schwa
   - [ˈθra.lu̥] > [ˈθra.lə]
   - [ˈwar.du̥] > [ˈwar.də]
   - [ˈta.ku̥] > [ˈta.kə]

## Early Hick (~600 PF onward)

1. Final schwa deletion
   - [ˈθra.lə] > [ˈθral]
   - [ˈwar.də] > [ˈward]
   - [ˈta.kə] > [ˈtak]

- Purely oral tradition
- Core maritime and nature vocabulary established
- Complex compound system develops
- Sacred/ritual terminology crystallizes

## Middle Hick (300 PF to 105 AI)

- More consistent contact with pre-Kalassarian traders
- Maritime trade vocabulary expansion
- Astronomical terminology development
- Sacred site naming conventions formalize
- Initial written forms appear (borrowed script)

## Late Hick/Early Seneran (105 AI to 400 AI)

- Kalassarian settlement period begins
- Administrative terminology adoption
- Initial sound changes:
  - Unstressed vowel reduction begins
  - Compound simplification starts
  - Some liquid deletion word-internally

## Middle Seneran (400 AI to 900 AI)

- Major sound changes:
  - Full unstressed vowel reduction
  - Resyllabification for CV preference
  - Systematic liquid/nasal deletion
  - Stress-related vowel lengthening
- Example: [in.nes.bel] → [i.ne.spel]

## Modern Seneran (900 AI to present)

- Extensive contact with Apgarian kingdoms
- Final changes:
  - Complete syllable restructuring
  - Final cluster simplification
  - Vowel length phonemicization
- Example: [i.ne.spel] → [ine.spell]

# Proto-Hick Reconstruction

## Overview

Early Hick shows a relatively conservative phonological system inherited from
Proto-Hick, with significant changes occurring mainly in compound formation and
unstressed syllables. See: [Historical Development](#historical-development)

See: [Sound Changes in Compounds](@/languages/hick/early-hick/compounds.md)

### Vowel Sequences

1. Permitted Diphthongs:

   - Within morphemes: /ai/, /ei/
   - At morpheme boundaries:
     - /ei-ae/ → [ei]
     - /ai-ae/ → [ae]
   - No three-vowel sequences

2. Examples:
   - /kei-aes/ → [ke.es] "sky flow"
   - /thrai-aes/ → [thraes] "sacred flow"
   - /brai-aes/ → [braes] "swift flow"

### Weight Distribution Constraints

1. Stress Patterns

   - Primary stress falls on first syllable of simple words
   - In compounds:
     - a. First element maintains primary stress
     - b. Second element reduces unless sacred/ritual term
     - c. Three-element compounds:
       - Primary stress on first element
       - Secondary stress on final element
       - Middle element reduces
   - Exceptions:
     - Sacred/ritual terms resist reduction
     - Maritime terms maintain second element weight
     - Recent compounds may preserve full weight
     - Morphological boundaries may preserve weight

   Examples:

   - tor-mal → [ˈto.məl] "great pool"
   - thral-kel → [ˈθral.kel] "sacred sky" (no reduction - sacred term)
   - tor-ma-ter → [ˈtor.mə.ˌter] "great-pool-flow"
   - bram-ma-ter → [ˈbram.ma.ˌter] "tide-vessel" (no reduction - maritime)

## Prosodic System

### Stress Patterns

1. Primary Stress
   - Falls on first syllable of root in isolation
   - Maintained in prefixation: ma-tor → [ˈma.tor]
   - Shifts in compounds: tor-mal → [tor.ˈmal]
2. Secondary Stress
   - In three-syllable compounds: tor-ma-ter → [ˈtor.mə.ˌter]
   - In prefix chains: ma-ka-tor → [ˈma.kə.ˌtor]
3. Stress-Related Changes
   - Unstressed /a/ → [ə]
   - Stressed vowels resist reduction
   - Compound stress affects vowel quality

## Compound Phonology

### Sound Changes in Compounds

1. Liquid Deletion

   - tor-mal → tomal "lake"
   - val-mal → vamal "spirit pool"
   - thral-gral → thragral "sacred earth"

2. Nasal Deletion

   - bram-mal → bramal "tidal pool"
   - bran-kel → brakel "morning sky"

3. Vowel Coalescence
   - kei-aes → kees "sky flow"
   - thrai-aes → thraes "sacred flow"

### Compound Types

1. Element + Element

   - kur-tin → kurtin "bronze" (copper-tin)
   - mal-ter → mater "stream" (pool-flow)

2. Descriptor + Element
   - gra-kur → grakur "grey copper"
   - tor-mal → tomal "great pool"

## Allophonic Rules

### Vowel Allophony

The vowel /a/ surfaces as [ə]:

1. After sibilants and affricates:

   - /sak/ → [sək] "wolf"
   - /sal/ → [səl] "stone"

2. After voiceless stops in unstressed syllables:

   - /karan/ → [kərən] "stream"
   - /tamal/ → [təmal] "pool-like"

3. In grammatical prefixes:

   - /ka-/ → [kə-] (similarity prefix)
   - /ma-/ → [mə-] (plural prefix) See:
     [Morphological Prefixes](@/languages/hick/early-hick/morphology.md#prefixes)

4. Between identical consonants:
   - /malam/ → [məlam] "pooled"
   - /ranar/ → [rənər] "flowing"

### Stress-Dependent Reduction

1. In Compounds:

   - First element maintains stress: 'tor-mal → ['tor.məl]
   - Second element reduced: mal-'ter → [məl.'ter]

2. With Prefixes:

   - Stressed prefix blocks reduction: 'ma-tor → ['ma.tor]
   - Unstressed prefix shows reduction: ka-'tor → [kə.'tor]

3. In Three-syllable Words:
   - Primary stress blocks reduction: 'ka-ra-nal → ['ka.rə.nəl]
   - Secondary stress partially blocks: ˌka-'ra-nal → [ˌka.'ra.nəl]

#### Exceptions

- Maintains [a] in:
  - Stressed syllables
  - Sacred/formal terms
  - Recent compounds See:
    [Sacred Terminology](@/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md#sacred--ritual)

### Consonant Allophony

## Historical Sound Changes

See: [Historical Development](#historical-development) for chronological stages

# Core Grammar

## Ergative-Absolutive Alignment

- -el [el] (ERG): marks agent of transitive verbs
- -es [es] (ABS): marks patient of transitive & sole argument of intransitive

Early Hick can be described as a language with an ergative-absolutive alignment.
Languages with this alignment treat the "subject" of an intransitive verb like
the "object" of a transitive verb. This "object" or "patient" referent is marked
with the _absolutive_ case marker -es. The "subject" or "agent" referent is
marked with the _ergative_ case marker -el.

```plaintext
materokel 'al-es venitar
handler-ERG person-ABS burden.SUP
"The handler carries the person"
```

In the above example, the handler _materok_ is the agent of the verb "to carry"
and is marked with the ergative case marker -el. The person _'al_ is the patient
of the verb and is marked with the absolutive case marker -es.

```plaintext
'ales barak'er
person-ABS walk-VERB
"The person walks"
```

The single argument of the intransitive verb _barak'er_ is the one performing
the action, but because Early Hick is an ergative-absolutive language, the
absolutive case marker -es is used to mark the referent.

### Development of the Ergative Case Marking -el

The Early Hick ergative marker -el derives from Proto-Hick \*mela through
parallel but distinct development from the definite article:

1. Sound Changes:

   - \*mela > \*mel (final vowel loss)
   - \*mel > -el (initial m-loss in unstressed position)

2. Functional Development:

   - Original meaning: definite animate marker
   - Intermediate stage: marks definite agents
   - Final stage: general ergative marker

## Verbal System

See: [Verbal Morphology](#verbal-morphology) for details on:

Early Hick has no true verb class. Verbs are formed from nouns and property
concepts and are marked with the verbalizer affix _-'er_.

```plaintext
'al'isel ven'er 'ales
person.PROX.ERG yoke.VERB person.ABS
this person carries a person
I am carrying a person
```

The above example shows the word _ven_ that means yoke or burden with the
verbalizer _-er_ affixed to it. It then acts as the verb of the sentence that
means "to carry".

While some words, such as _barak_ "walk", semantically denote actions, the
verbalizer affix _-'er_ is still applied in most instances.

```plaintext
'ales barak'er
person-ABS walk-VERB
"The person walks."
```

## Spatial Case System

(See: [Spatial Case System](#spatial-case-system)

Early Hick uses case marking to modify a word to indicate the direction an
action is performed.

The spatial cases are:

- -las (ILL): "inward, into"
- -imris (ELL): "outward, from"
- -itar (SUPE): "upward, upon"
- -esp (SUB): "under, below"
- -asam (SUBE): "downward, onto"

These spatial cases are typically appended to verbal words to indicate the
direction an action is performed. When used with transitive verbs, the spatial
cases indicate the direction of the action done by the agent, in relation to the
patient.

```plaintext
branum galel belaes rismateres
PAST man-ERG entrance-ILL reed boat-ABS
The man inward-entrance the reed boat.
The man entered the reed boat.
```

The above example shows the man _gal_ entering the boat _rismater_. There is
another way to express this sentence using the spatial case marker, removing the
explicit verbal word _bel_ "entrance".

```plaintext
branum gales rismater-aes
PAST man-ABS reed boat-ILL
The man entered the reed boat.
```

Since the man is moving inward, into the reed boat, and there is no reason to
specify that the man entered through the entrance, the spatial case marker -aes
may be appended to _rismater_ to indicate that the man entered the boat.

## Temporal System

### Tense Marking

See: [Clause Structure and Word Order](#clause-structure-and-word-order)

The basic temporal markers are added to the beginning of a clause to indicate
the time of the action.

| Tense Marker | Meaning  |
| ------------ | -------- |
| branum       | past     |
| branrum      | far past |
| mulsum       | future   |

```plaintext
branum 'ales venitar
PAST person-ABS yoke-SUPE
PAST person lift
"The person lifted."
```

```plaintext
branrum 'ales venitar
FAR PAST person-ABS yoke-SUPE
FAR PAST person lifted
"The person lifted long ago."
```

```plaintext
mulsum 'ales venitar
FUT person-ABS yoke-SUPE
"The person will lift."
```

## Conjunctions

### Conjunctions

Early Hick has several conjunctions for connecting elements:

- ru [ru] "and" - general coordinator
- ewes [e.wes] "together with" - marks shared/joint actions
- 'aterbran [ʔa.ter.bran] "before" - temporal sequence
- 'aterimris [ʔa.te.rim.ris] "after" - temporal sequence
- imris [im.ris] "because" - causal relationships

For detailed discussion of conjunction types and usage, see:
[Syntax: Conjunctions](#conjunctions)

# Morphology

## Nominal Morphology

### Agentive Marking

1. Primary Marker
   - -ok [ok]: agentive nominalizer (forms agent nouns, both occupational and
     active) Examples:
   - materok "boatman" < mater-ok "vessel-AGENT" (one who works with vessels)
   - wardok "guide" < ward-ok "direct-AGENT" (one who directs)
   - threnok "watcher" < thren-ok "watch-AGENT" (one who watches)

### Size and Intensity Markers

1. Diminutive (li-)

   - Prefix meaning "small, lesser"
   - Examples:
     - limal [li.mal] "small pool, pond"
     - liren [li.ren] "small deer, fawn"
     - lines [li.nes] "small fish, minnow"

2. Augmentative (tor-)
   - Prefix meaning "great, mighty" (from "height, peak")
   - Examples:
     - tornes [tor.nes] "great fish, whale"
     - topel [to.pel] "great bear" (tor-pel → topel, liquid deletion)
     - tomal [to.mal] "great pool, - lake" (tor-mal → tomal, liquid deletion)
3. Speed Augmentative (tor- -sim)
   - Circumfix combining the argumentative tor- with the translative -sim to
     mean a swift change in speed of the action

### Number Marking

Early Hick has three strategies for marking number:

1. Plural Prefix ma-
   - Indicates general plurality
   - ma-mater "boats"

2. Partitive Prefix ran- (< *haranu "divide")
   - Indicates "some of" or "part of"
   - ran-mater "some boats"
   - Can develop limiter meaning in context

3. Numerical Marking with ran-
   - Links numbers to nouns
   - thal-ran-mater "three boats"
   - pil-ran-natlas "five friends"

4. Fractional Marking with ran-
   The partitive prefix ran- can also mark fractions when used with numbers:

   ```plaintext
   tirranrakter
   two-PART-league
   "half-league" (league divided in two)
   
   sinranvinuram
   three-PART-yard
   "third of a yard" (yard divided in three)
   ```

   Note that this creates ambiguity with numerical marking, as number-ran-noun
   can mean either "X number of nouns" or "1/X of a noun" depending on context:

   ```plaintext
   tirranlis
   two-PART-child
   "two children" (numerical marking)

   tirranrakter
   two-PART-league
   "half-league" (fractional marking)
   ```

   The interpretation depends on:
   - Whether the noun can be meaningfully divided
   - The pragmatic context (counting vs measuring)
   - The register (technical vs general usage)

   This ambiguity becomes particularly relevant in measurement and trade contexts,
   where both counting and dividing are common.

4. Exclusivity Marking telran-
   The partitive prefix ran- can combine with tel- to form telran-, marking
   exclusivity:

   These markers are mutually exclusive in the same position class:
   (NEG)-(ADJ)-(PLURAL/PART/NUM-PART)-(SIZE)-ROOT

   ```plaintext
   telran-materok
   EXCL.PART-handler
   "only the handlers" (specifically excluding non-handlers)
   ran-materok
   PART-handler
   "some handlers" (neutral partitive)
   ```

   contrasting with the neutral partitive which simply indicates a subset. This
   distinction is particularly useful in:

   - Social group identification
   - Professional designations
   - Ritual contexts

### Adjectival Marking

From its Proto-Hick root \*kasu, with the sense of reflection upon a mirror-like
surface, the prefix _ka-_ was initially used to denote similarity. Over time, it
had applied to a wide range of concepts, becoming a general adjectivizer.

1. Similarity Prefix (ka-)
   - Prefix meaning "like, similar to"
   - Always surfaces as [kə-] due to regular vowel reduction
   - Examples:
     - ka-tor [kə.tor] "hill-like" (smaller than a mountain)
     - ka-mal [kə.mal] "pond-like" (smaller than a lake)
     - ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)
     - Natural Features: kətor "hill-like", kəmal "pond-like"
     - Animals: kəpel "bear-like", kəmer "bird-like"
     - Body Parts: kəbel "mouth-like", kəven "wing-like"
     - Weather: kəbran "storm-like", kəthral "mist-like"
     - Water Movement: kəran "stream-like", kəthrim "wave-like"
     - Plant Growth: kəthir "grass-like", kəbel "vine-like"
     - Sounds: kəmer "bird-like (sound)", kəsak "wolf-like (howl)"
2. Adjectival Suffix (ka-)
   - Extended beyond just similarity, it has since been used to derive more
     metaphorically related concepts beyond a comparative sense. such as:
     - kasul [ka.sul] "energetic" < ka-sul "liver-like"
     - kames [ka.mes] "emotional" < ka-mes "heart-like"
3. Use with Translative -sim When ka- prefixed forms take the translative suffix
   -sim, they indicate becoming like the base noun:

   a. Intransitive use (spontaneous change):

   ```plaintext
   mes-es kames-sim
   heart-ABS heart.like-TRANS
   "The heart becomes emotional" (lit. "becomes heart-like")
   ```

   b. Transitive use (caused change):

   ```plaintext
   sibris-el mes-es kames-sim
   love-ERG heart-ABS heart.like-TRANS
   "Love makes the heart emotional" (lit. "love makes heart become heart-like")

   'al-el sul-es kasul-sim
   person-ERG liver-ABS liver.like-TRANS
   "The person energizes the liver" (lit. "person makes liver become liver-like")
   ```

   Note: In transitive uses, the ergative marks the agent causing the change,
   while the absolutive marks what undergoes the change. See also:
   [Object Control Constructions](#object-control-constructions) for extended
   use in expressing commands.

#### Adjective Ordering

Multiple ka- adjectives follow this order:

1. Quality/Evaluation (ka-'il "good-like", ka-thral "sacred-like")
2. Purpose/Association (ka-keth "sea-like", ka-tag "craft-like")
3. Material Nature (ka-wud "wood-like", ka-sul "flesh-like")
4. Physical Property (ka-mal "round-like", ka-ris "straight-like")

#### Natural Pattern

The original and common spoken pattern is direct stacking:

ka-'il ka-keth ka-wud ka-mal mater-es
ADJ-good ADJ-sea ADJ-wood ADJ-round boat-ABS
"good sea-worthy wooden round boat"

#### Literary Style

After the introduction of Elven writing (c. 800 PF), a formal coordinated style
developed based on the "o...ru" nominal coordination pattern:

'il o keth o wud o mal ka-es mater-es
good PART sea PART wood PART round ADJ-ABS boat-ABS
"good and sea-worthy and wooden and round boat"

This literary innovation appears primarily in written texts and formal speech.

### Demonstrative System

1. Visible/Known, Proximal
   - -is [is] "this" (inanimate)
   - -ʔis [ʔis] "this" (animate)
2. Visible/Known, Medial
   - -en [en] "that" (inanimate)
   - -tan [tan] "that" (animate)
3. Hidden but Sensed
   - -eth [eθ] "this/that" (inanimate)
   - -thir [θir] "this/that" (animate)
4. Distant/Out of Sight
   - -um [um] "that" (inanimate)
   - -rum [rum] "that" (animate)

### Personal Reference

1. Spatial Demonstratives
   - istal "this.place-person" (speaker's location)
   - etal "that.place-person" (addressee's location)
   - utal "far.place-person" (third party location)

### Negation System

1. Basic Negation
   - mo- [mo]: general negation prefix Examples:
     - mo-thral "non-sacred, profane"
     - mo-ter "not flowing, stagnant"
     - mo-ward "misdirect, lead astray"

### Possession Marking

The possessive suffix -ul marks ownership and possession relationships:

1. Structure
   - Suffix -ul attaches to possessor noun
   - Possessed noun follows directly
   - No additional marking on possessed noun

   ```plaintext
   materok-ul rismater 
   handler-POSS boat
   "the handler's boat"
   ```

2. Semantic Range
   - Physical possession ("X's Y")
   - Ownership ("belonging to X")
   - Abstract possession ("X's qualities")
   - Kinship ("X's relative")

## Verbal Morphology

### Verbalizer

- -'er ['er]: creates verbs from nouns and property concepts (See:
  [Proto-Hick](@/languages/hick/proto-hick.md#segmental-inventory))
- If -'er is preceded by a plosive, it surfaces as [er]

```plaintext
mulis-'er [mulis.ʔer] "dreaminɡ"
tak-er [tak.er] "strike"
```

#### Active verbs (from action/motion concepts)

```plaintext
ai-es ter-'er
water-ABS flow-VERB
"Water flows"

materok-el 'al-es ward-'er
handler-ERG person-ABS guide-VERB
"The handler guides the person"
```

Examples:

- ter-'er "to flow" (See:
  [Water Features](@/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md#water-features))
- thren-'er "to watch" (See:
  [Sacred Terms](@/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md#sacred--ritual))
- ward-'er "to guide"

#### Stative verbs (from property concepts)

Stative verbs are formed from property concepts using the verbalizer -ʔer. In
order to disambiguate from active verbs, in most cases, the adjectivizer prefix
ka- is prepended to the verb.

```plaintext
tor-thir-es kathral-'er
peak-KNOWN.ANIM-ABS ADJ-sacred-VERB
"The known peak is sacred"

kel-es ka-mar-'er
sky-ABS ADJ-red-VERB
"The sky is red"
```

Examples:

- thral-'er "to be sacred" (See:
  [Sacred Terms](@/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md#sacred--ritual))
- mar-'er "to be red" (See:
  [Colors](@/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md#colors))

Note: Interpretation depends on base word semantics:

- Action/motion roots → active verbs (ter "flow", ward "guide")
- Property roots → stative verbs (thral "sacred") (See:
  [Basic Terms](@/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md#basic-terms))

### Mood {#morphological-mood}

Early Hick marks certain modal meanings through verbal suffixes. For syntactic
modal constructions, see: [Syntactic Mood](#syntactic-mood)

#### Volitional Marker -'arm

The volitional suffix -arm (< Proto-Hick *harmu "willing") marks intention or
willingness. Like other modal suffixes, it replaces the verbalizer -'er:

```plaintext
# Intransitive
'al'ises wardarm
person.DEM.PROX.ANIM.VIS-ABS guide.VOL
"I am willing to guide"

# Transitive
'al'isel threnarm tores
person.DEM.PROX.ANIM.VIS-ERG watch.VOL mountain.ABS
"I am willing to watch the mountain"
```

Common forms:

- ward'er → wardarm "willing to guide"
- thren'er → threnarm "willing to watch"
- tak'er → takarm "willing to strike"

Note: The volitional often appears in ritual contexts and formal pledges,
suggesting its historical connection to expressions of sacred duty or
obligation. See also: [Sacred Terms](@/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md#sacred--ritual)

#### Desiderative Marker -nat

The desiderative suffix -nat (< Proto-Hick *gnar-ter "correct-flow") marks
desire or intention. It replaces the verbalizer -'er and preserves the
transitivity of the base verb:

1. With intransitive verbs:

   ```plaintext
   'al'ises imerespnat
   person.DEM.PROX.ANIM.VIS-ABS sleep.DES.VERB
   "I want to sleep"
   ```

   The sole argument takes absolutive case as expected for S arguments.

2. With transitive verbs:

   ```plaintext
   'al'isel hilisnat 'altales
   person.DEM.PROX.ANIM.VIS-ERG look.DES.VERB person.DEM.MED.VIS.ANIM-ABS
   "I want to see you"
   ```

   Both A and P arguments maintain regular ergative-absolutive marking.

This construction shows Early Hick's consistent syntactic ergativity, handling
desires through morphological means rather than control syntax.

## Spatial Case System

Early Hick's spatial case system interacts closely with verbal semantics,
marking not only physical direction but also abstract state changes and
causation.

1. Basic Spatial Cases

   - -las (ILL): "inward, into"
   - -imris (ELL): "outward, from"
   - -itar (SUPE): "upward, upon"
   - -asam (SUBE): "downward, onto"
   - -esp (SUB): "under, below"

2. Directional Usage

   ```plaintext
   materok-el rismater-las
   handler-ERG reed.boat-ILL
   "The handler enters the reed boat"

   materok-el rismater-imris
   handler-ERG reed.boat-ELL
   "The handler exits the reed boat"

   materok-el rismater-itar
   handler-ERG reed.boat-SUPE
   "The handler climbs onto the reed boat"

   materok-el rismater-asam
   handler-ERG reed.boat-SUBE
   "The handler climbs down from the reed boat"
   ```

3. Change of State

   - Spatial cases extend to mark state changes
   - See: [Adjectival System](#adjectival-morphology) for full details

   ```plaintext
   kamar kel-es kakel-las
   red sky-ABS blue-ILL
   "red sky turns blue"
   ```

4. Syntactic Properties
   - Supplants ergative case in motion contexts
   - Can be fronted for emphasis
   - Implies motion/change without overt verb
   - Interacts with causative constructions

## Adjectival Morphology

Early Hick has no true adjective class. Quality concepts are expressed through:

1. Stative Verbs (See: [Verbal Morphology](#verbal-morphology))

   - Uses verbalizer -ʔer
   - Takes absolutive argument Examples:

   ```plaintext
   kel-es kakel-ʔer
   sky-ABS blue-VERB
   "The sky is blue"

   thral-el kel-es kakel-ʔer
   ritual-ERG sky-ABS blue-VERB
   "The ritual makes the sky blue"
   ```

2. Change of State

   1. Translative (-sim):

      ```plaintext
      kel-es kakel-sim
      sky.ABS blue.TRANS
      "sky becomes blue"
      ```

   2. Directional Cases (-las/-imris):

      ```plaintext
      kamar kel-es kakel-las
      red sky-ABS blue-ILL
      "red sky turns blue"
      ```

3. Notes:
   - No attributive modification
   - All qualities are verbal predicates
   - Follows ergative-absolutive alignment
   - Causatives marked by adding ergative agent

## Derivational Morphology

### Similarity Prefix

- ka- [kə]: prefix meaning "like, similar to"
- Always surfaces as [kə-] due to regular vowel reduction Examples:
- ka-tor [kə.tor] "hill-like" (smaller than a mountain)
- ka-mal [kə.mal] "pond-like" (smaller than a lake)
- ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)

### Negation System

- mo- [mo]: general negation prefix Examples:
- mo-thral "non-sacred, profane"
- mo-ter "not flowing, stagnant"
- mo-ward "misdirect, lead astray"

### Compound Formation

- Basic Pattern: modifier-head
- Sound changes:
  - Liquid deletion: tor-mal → tomal
  - Nasal deletion: bram-mal → bramal
  - glottal stop deletion also removes immediately succeeding vowel: 'irur-'ilis
    → 'irurlis
  - Examples:
    - kur-tin → kurtin "bronze" (copper-tin)
    - bram-mater → brammater "river vessel" (tide-vessel)
    - thral-kel → thrakel "sun" (sacred-sky)
  
#### Action Nominal Compounds

Action nominal compounds require the verbalizer -'er as part of the compound
structure:

BASE-VERB'er (e.g., mater-tag'er, pel-thren'er)

Unlike regular compounds, action nominals preserve morphological boundaries and
resist normal compound phonology:

- mater-tag'er → [ma.ter.tag.ʔer] (not *[ma.te.tag.ʔer])
- pel-thren'er → [pel.θren.ʔer]

This preservation of boundaries:

- Maintains transparency of components
- Shows clear verbal derivation
- Parallels treatment of sacred/ritual terms
- Helps parse complex forms

Compare:

- tor-mal → tomal "great pool" (regular compound)
- tor-mal'er → tor-mal'er "pool-expanding" (action nominal)

##### Restrictions

1. Base Requirements:
   - First element must be a concrete noun (*mater-tag'er "boat-making" but
     not*thral-tag'er "sacred-making")
   - Second element must be an action-capable root (tag'er "make", thren'er
     "watch", but not *sul'er "liver-VERB")

2. Semantic Restrictions:
   - Must describe culturally recognized activities
   - Cannot form from abstract or metaphorical relationships
   - Maritime and craft terms particularly productive
   - Sacred/ritual terms require special authorization

3. Structural Limits:
   - Maximum of one nominal base + one verbal element
   - Cannot stack multiple actions (*mater-tag-thren'er)
   - Cannot incorporate case markers (*materel-tag'er)

Note: For professional or habitual agents, Early Hick uses the agentive suffix
-ok instead:

- 'irurvinudok "house cleaner" (house-clean-AGENT)
- matertagok "boat maker" (boat-make-AGENT)
- pelthrenok "bear watcher" (bear-watch-AGENT)

Action nominals focus on the activity itself, while agentive forms indicate the
performer of the action.

Note: For professional or habitual agents, Early Hick uses the agentive suffix
-ok with regular compound formation:

- 'iruvinudok "house cleaner" < 'irur-vinud-ok "hollow-dwelling-AGENT"
  (with liquid deletion)
- matagok "boat maker" < mater-tag-ok "boat-make-AGENT" (with liquid deletion)
- pethrenok "bear watcher" < pel-thren-ok "bear-watch-AGENT" (with liquid deletion)

Action nominals focus on the activity itself and preserve morphological
boundaries, while agentive forms follow regular compound phonology and indicate
the performer of the action.

### Body Metaphors

1. Breath as the soul
2. Liver as source of life
3. Heart as source of emotion
4. Bones as structure
5. Hands as tools
6. Eyes as reality
7. Skin as appearance
8. Skin, Hair as abstract senses
9. Stomach, gut as strength

## Affix Order

### Basic Template

1. Root Structure
   - (PREFIX*) + ROOT + (SUFFIX*)
   - Maximum of three prefixes and two suffixes

2. Order of Elements

```plaintext
(NEG)-(ADJ)-(PLURAL)-(SIZE)-ROOT-(AGENT)-(CASE)
```

Examples:

- mo-ka-tor-el (NEG-ADJ-height-ERG) "not height-like (as agent)"
- ka-ma-li-mal-ok-es (ADJ-PL-DIM-pool-AGENT-ABS) "small pool-like keepers"
- ka-tor-mal-el (ADJ-AUG-pool-ERG) "great pool-like thing (as agent)"

### Prefix Classes

1. Outer Prefixes (first position)
   - mo- (NEG): negation

2. Second Position
   - ka- (ADJ): adjectivizer

3. Third Position
   - ma- (PL): plural

4. Inner Prefixes (closest to root)
   - tor- (AUG): augmentative
   - li- (DIM): diminutive

### Suffix Classes

1. Inner Suffixes (closer to root)
   - -'er (VERB): verbalizer (See: [Verbal Morphology](#verbal-morphology))
   - -arm (VOL): volitional (See: [Morphological Mood](#morphological-mood))
   - -nat (DES): desiderative (See: [Morphological Mood](#morphological-mood))
   - -ok (AGENT): agentive (See: [Agentive Marking](#agentive-marking))

2. Outer Suffixes (final position)
   - -el (ERG): ergative case
   - -es (ABS): absolutive case
   - -imris (ELL): ellative case ("from")
   - -las (ILL): illative case ("into")
   - -itar (SUPE): superessive case ("upon")
   - -esp (SUBE): subessive case ("under")
   - -asam (SUB): sublative case ("onto")
   - -sim (TRANS): translative case ("becomes")

   See: [Spatial Case System](#spatial-case-system)

### Restrictions

1. Co-occurrence
   - Only one prefix from each position class
   - Maximum of one case suffix
   - Agent suffix must precede case suffix

2. Phonological Interactions
   - Prefix ka- always reduces to [kə-]
   - Unlike compounds, affixes do not trigger liquid or nasal deletion
   - Compare:
     - Compound: tor-mal → tomal "great pool" (liquid deletion)
     - Affix: tor-el → tor-el "height-ERG" (no deletion)

# Syntax

## Property Words and Modification

Early Hick uses property words (like English adjectives and adverbs) in three
main ways:

1. As Adjectives (modifying nouns)

   - Come before the noun they modify

   ```plaintext
   'irek litor-es etal
   firm hill-ABS that.MED
   "that firm hill" (like English "the tall tree")
   ```

2. As Predicate Adjectives (with verb marking)

   ```plaintext
   litor-es ka'irek'er
   hill-ABS ADJ-firm-VERB
   "The hill is firm" (like English "The tree is tall")
   ```

3. As Adverbs (modifying verbs)
   - Come after the verb they modify
   - Often take the similarity prefix ka-

   ```plaintext
   wen'altanes 'irek'er ka'irek
   woman.MED.VIS.ANIM-ABS stand-VERB firm-SIM
   "She stands firmly" (like English "-ly" adverbs)
   ```

This pattern means that word order shows whether a property word is acting like
an adjective (before nouns) or an adverb (after verbs).

## Clause Structure and Word Order

1. Basic Patterns

   - Core arguments marked by case, allowing flexible word order
   - Ergative (-el) marks agent of transitive verbs
   - Absolutive (-es) marks patient of transitive & sole argument of
     intransitive
   - Word order signals pragmatic functions rather than grammatical roles

2. Information Structure

   - Initial position: topic/focus or temporal frame
   - Final position: new information or emphasis
   - Examples:

     ```plaintext
     branum bramisimris kethes
     past    river-ELL    sea-ABS
     "In the past, the river flowed to the sea" (temporal frame first)

     kethes bramisimris branum
     sea-ABS river-ELL    past
     "The river flowed to the sea, in the past" (neutral statement)
     ```

3. Verb Position and Aspect

   - Verbs can occur in different positions based on aspect:

     ```plaintext
     materok-el rismater-es ward tel
     handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide COMPL
     "The handler has guided the reed boat" (completed action)

     rismater-es ward kethes
     reed.boat-ABS guide sea-ABS
     "The reed boat guides to sea" (general statement)
     ```

   - Directional constructions allow goal prominence:

     ```plaintext
     keth-aes materok-el rismater-es
     sea-ILL  handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS
     "To sea the handler (takes) the reed boat"
     ```

4. Temporal Reference

   - Time words can float freely but tend toward:
     - Initial: setting temporal frame for discourse
     - Pre-verbal: marking temporal contrast
     - Final: neutral narrative position
   - Examples:

     ```plaintext
     branum materok-el ward-ʔer  # Frame-setting
     past    handler-ERG guide-VERB
     "In the past, the handler guided"

     materok-el branum ward-ʔer  # Temporal contrast
     handler-ERG past    guide-ACT
     "The handler USED TO guide"

     materok-el ward-ʔer branum  # Neutral narrative
     handler-ERG guide-ACT past
     "The handler guided, in the past"
     ```

See: [Tense](#tense) and [Aspect](#aspect) for a complete description of:

- Past reference markers (branum, branrum)
- Future reference (mulsum)
- Completive aspect (tel)
- Position effects on temporal interpretation

### Comitative Construction

Early Hick marks accompaniment through the particle ewes, which precedes an
absolutive-marked participant:

```plaintext
'al'isel ewes Maries ward'er
person.DEM.PROX.ANIM.VIS-ERG WITH Mari-ABS travel.VERB
"I travel with Mari"
```

The primary participant takes ergative case while the accompanying participant
is marked absolutive. See also: [Conjunctions](#conjunctions) for coordinated
usage of ewes.

### Object Control Constructions

Early Hick has two primary strategies for expressing object control ("X tells Y
to do Z"):

#### Primary Construction: Causative-like Formation

Uses the adjectival prefix ka- with translative -sim to show caused state (See:
[Adjectival Marking](#adjectival-marking)):

```plaintext
branum 'al'isel kaimerespsim galtales
PAST person.PROX.ERG ADJ-sleep-TRANS man.MED.ABS
"I made him sleep" (lit. "I made him become sleep-like")
```

The construction maintains ergative-absolutive alignment, with the causer marked
ergative and the causee marked absolutive.

```plaintext
ma'altalel 'al'ises 'ilisimris'er [katagsim wen'er wenel]
PL.person.MED.ERG person.PROX.ABS teach.VERB [ADJ.give.TRANS bloom.VERB flower.ERG]
"They taught us to make flowers bloom"

'al'isel altales 'ilisimris'er [katagsim sul'er aiel]
person.PROX.ERG person.MED.ABS teach.VERB [ADJ.give.TRANS flow.VERB water.ERG]
"I taught them to make the water flow"
```

The embedded causative maintains its fixed [AUX VERB SUBJ] order even with
multiple verbs, while the matrix clause remains flexible:

```plaintext
altales 'al'isel [katagsim sul'er aiel] 'ilisimris'er
person.MED.ABS person.PROX.ERG [ADJ.give.TRANS flow.VERB water.ERG] teach.VERB
"Them, I taught to make the water flow"
```

#### Quotative Strategy

Uses relative clause structure to frame commands as reported speech:

   ```plaintext
branum 'al'isel ['alises paket'er imerespes!] galtalimrises
PAST person.PROX.ERG [who.ABS say.VERB sleep.IMP.ABS!] man.MED.ELL.ABS
"I who said 'sleep!' to him"
```

Key features:

- Relative clause with 'alis- as relativizer
- Imperative marked with absolutive -es
- Recipient marked with ellative -imris
- Commands treated as affecting their target (like P arguments)

### Reflexive Constructions

Early Hick marks reflexive relationships primarily through case marking and
demonstrative agreement:

1. Basic Reflexives
With transitive verbs, the agent takes ergative case and the reflexive object
takes illative:

   ```plaintext
   galtalel tallas hilis'er
   person.MED.ERG MED.ILL look.VERB
   "He looked at himself"

   ma'altalel matallas pak'er
   PL.person.MED.ERG PL.MED.ILL speak.VERB
   "They spoke among themselves"
   ```

2. Indirect Objects
For ditransitive verbs, reflexive recipients take illative case:

   ```plaintext
   'al'isel 'islas taglas'er 'iruretiles
   person.PROX.ERG PROX.ILL give.ITER.VERB gift.ABS
   "I gave myself a gift"

   wen'altalel tallas paket'irur
   woman.MED.ERG MED.ILL talk.ITER
   "She told herself stories"
   ```

Key features:

- Demonstrative agreement between agent and reflexive forms
- Illative case (-las) marks reflexive targets
- Number agreement maintained in plural forms
- Regular ergative-absolutive alignment for non-reflexive arguments

4. Method/Means Expression
   Uses the object control construction with ka- prefix and translative -sim to
   express how an action is performed:

   ```plaintext
   'al'isel paketes katenwasim tenwa'er
   person.PROX.ERG speech.ABS ADJ.write.TRANS write.VERB
   "I wrote the speech through writing"

   materok-el rismater-es katagasim ward'er
   handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS ADJ.craft.TRANS guide.VERB
   "The handler guides the reed boat through crafting"
   ```

   The construction treats the method as a caused state change, following the
   same pattern as other reflexive and causative expressions in Early Hick.

### Comparative Constructions

Early Hick has two primary strategies for expressing comparisons: similarity/
equivalence marking and relative degree constructions.

#### Similarity and Equivalence

Early Hick marks similarity through two related constructions derived from
Proto-Hick *kasu "reflection":

1. Simple Comparisons
   Uses the ka- prefix for straightforward comparisons with single nouns:

   ```plaintext
   kamales ward'er
   ADJ.pool.ABS contain.VERB
   "(It) contains like a pool"
   ```

2. Complex Comparisons
   Uses kas conjunction for phrases with modifiers:

   ```plaintext
   kas [kameris kethbranes] tagimris'er
   LIKE [ADJ.love kin.ABS] give.VERB
   "As beloved kin give"
   ```

#### Relative Degree

Early Hick expresses relative degree through a specialized construction using
spatial cases. The construction treats comparisons as stative predicates with
two arguments:

1. The comparable (what's being compared) takes absolutive case
2. The comparator (what it's compared to) takes either superessive (-itar) or
   subessive (-asam) case
3. The quality being compared is expressed as a stative verb with -'er

##### Greater Than

Uses the superessive case (-itar "upon/above"):

```plaintext
tores tor'er malitar
mountain-ABS height-VERB pool-SUPE
"The mountain is taller than the pool"
(lit. "mountain heights above-pool")

'ales vinu'er 'altanitar
person-ABS birth-VERB man-SUPE
"The person is older than the man"
(lit. "person births above-man")
```

##### Less Than

Uses the subessive case (-asam "under/below"):

```plaintext
males tor'er torasam
pool-ABS height-VERB mountain-SUBE
"The pool is less tall than the mountain"
(lit. "pool heights under-mountain")

'altanes vinu'er 'alasam
man-ABS birth-VERB person-SUBE
"The man is younger than the person"
(lit. "man births under-person")
```

##### Equality

Uses the comparative particle kas (see: [Comparative Markers](#development-of-comparative-markers)):

```plaintext
kas males tores tor'er
LIKE pool-ABS mountain-ABS height-VERB
"The pool is as tall as the mountain"
(lit. "like pool mountain heights")
```

##### Syntactic Properties

The comparative construction shows several important properties:

1. Case Alignment
   - Comparable takes absolutive case (-es)
   - Comparator takes spatial case (-itar/-asam)
   - Maintains ergative-absolutive alignment pattern

2. Word Order
   - Basic order: COMPARABLE-ABS QUALITY-VERB COMPARATOR-SUPE/SUBE
   - Follows standard clause structure flexibility

3. Multiple Comparators
   - Can be coordinated with ru:

   ```plaintext
   tores tor'er [mal o keth ruitar]
   mountain-ABS height-VERB [pool PART sea AND-SUPE]
   "The mountain is taller than both the pool and sea"
   ```

   - Similarly for subessive comparisons:

     ```plaintext
     males tor'er [tor o keth ruasam]
     pool-ABS height-VERB [mountain PART sea AND-SUBE]
     "The pool is shorter than both the mountain and sea"
     ```

   The case marking attaches to the coordinator ru rather than to individual
   nouns, following Early Hick's general coordination pattern.

4. Negation
   - Negates the stative verb with mo-:

   ```plaintext
   males motor'er torasam
   pool-ABS NEG-height-VERB mountain-SUBE
   "The pool is not less tall than the mountain"
   ```

5. Temporal Reference
   - Takes standard temporal markers:

   ```plaintext
   branum 'ales vinu'er 'altanitar
   PAST person-ABS birth-VERB man-SUPE
   "The person was older than the man"
   ```

## Tense

Clauses without explicit temporal marking in Early Hick express present tense.
These unmarked clauses can indicate either simple present ("walks") or present
progressive ("is walking") readings, with the specific interpretation determined
by context and predicate semantics. For example:

```plaintext
'ales      barak'er
person-ABS walk-VERB
"The person walks/is walking"
```

### Tense Markers

When temporal specification is required, Early Hick employs three temporal
markers that operate at the clause level:

- `branum` (past)
- `mulsum` (future)
- `branrum` (far past)

### Usage

In a simple clause, the temporal tense marker can be typically found in the
beginning or end of the clause.

```plaintext
branum materok-el  ward-'er
past   handler-ERG guide-VERB
"The handler guided (in the past)"
```

   ```plaintext
mulsum materok-el  ward-'er
future handler-ERG guide-VERB
"The handler will guide"
```

In contexts where aesthetic or poetic effect is desired, the marker can be found
right before the verbal phrase.

   ```plaintext
'ales      mulsum barak'er
person-ABS future walk-VERB
"The person will walk"
```

#### Relative Clauses

In relative clauses where the dependent clause refers to a different time frame
than the main clause, temporal markers may occur after the relativizer. See:
[Relative Clauses](#relative-clauses)

For example:

   ```plaintext
'altanel         ['alises branum thren'er] ward'er
man-MED.VIS.ANIM [WHO-ABS PAST watch.VERB] guide.VERB
"That man who watches guides"
```

   ```plaintext
mulsum   'altanel         ['alises branum thren'er] ward'er
FUT      man-MED.VIS.ANIM [WHO-ABS PAST watch.VERB] guide.VERB
"That man who watches guides"
```

#### Complex Clauses

When clauses are linked by coordinators, each clause may carry its own temporal
marking to indicate different time frames:

   ```plaintext
[clause + temporal marker] coordinator [clause + temporal marker]
```

Note that the flexibility of the temporal marker position is still available in
each clause

### The Distant Past Marker `branrum`

Early Hick has developed a special case marker for use when referring to events
that had occurred in the distant past. The marker _branrum_ is often only ever
uttered in either religious contexts or in epic poetry.

When it is used, it functions similarly to the past marker _branum_.

## Aspect

Early Hick aspect markers are typically found following the verbalized word that
they modify, however, in some aesthetic contexts, they may be placed at the end
of the clause.

These aspect markers may be used in conjunction with the temporal markers to
indicate different time frames.

When a clause does not carry an aspect marker, it is understood to be either in
the simple or the progressive aspect.

### Progressive Aspect Marker `terum`

In cases where the speaker wishes to emphasize ongoing or continuous states, the
progressive aspect marker `terum` (< `ter` "flow" + `-rum`) can be used. These
aspect markers may be used in conjunction with the temporal markers to indicate
different time frames.

```plaintext
'ales      barak'er  terum
person-ABS walk-VERB flow.DIST
"The person is walking"

branum 'ales      barak'er  terum
PAST   person-ABS walk-VERB flow.DIST
"The person has been walking"
```

### Completive Aspect Marker `tel`

The completive aspect marker `tel` indicates finished actions.

   ```plaintext
'ales      barak'er  tel
person-ABS walk-VERB COMPL
"The person has walked"

branum 'ales      barak'er  tel
PAST   person-ABS walk-VERB COMPL
"The person had walked"
```

### Iterative Aspect

The Early Hick iterative marker works differently from the other aspect markers.
It instead marks on an action word and replaces the verbalizer _-'er_. It has
three register-dependent forms, all deriving from Proto-Hick \*heru-heru
"motion-motion":

1. Formal/Ritual: -'irur

     ```plaintext
   'ales barak'irur
   person-ABS walk-ITER
   "The person walks repeatedly" (formal/ritual context)
   ```

2. Common: -rur

     ```plaintext
   'ales barakrur
   person-ABS walk.ITER
   "The person walks repeatedly" (everyday usage)
   ```

3. Colloquial: -ur

     ```plaintext
   'ales barakur
   person-ABS walk.ITER
   "The person walks repeatedly" (casual speech)
   ```

The development shows typical grammaticalization path:

1. Reduplicated noun \*heru-heru > 'irur "repetition"
2. Grammaticalization to verbal suffix -'irur
3. Phonological reduction in common speech (-rur)
4. Further reduction in colloquial register (-ur)

Note: The formal register preserves the etymological form with glottal stop,
while common and colloquial registers show progressive reduction typical of
grammaticalized elements.

## Mood {#syntactic-mood}

Early Hick expresses some modal meanings through syntactic constructions. For
morphological mood marking, see: [Verbal Mood](#morphological-mood)

### Imperative Construction

Early Hick forms imperatives by dropping the verbalizer -'er and adding
absolutive -es to the verb stem. The construction shows distinct word order
and case marking from declarative sentences:

```plaintext
# Declarative
'al'isel tor ward'er
person.ERG mountain guide.VERB
"The person guides the mountain"

# Imperative
tor 'il wardes!
mountain good guide.IMP.ABS
"guide the mountain well!"
```

Key features:

1. Object appears first and unmarked for case
2. Modifiers directly precede the verb
3. Verb takes absolutive marking
4. No overt ergative agent

This construction represents one context where Early Hick deviates from its
ergative-absolutive alignment, showing split ergativity typical of command
forms.

Examples with different modifiers:

```plaintext
mes   thral  threndes!
heart sacred watch.IMP.ABS
"watch the heart sacredly!"
materok ka'il    wardes!
boat    ADJ.good guide.IMP.ABS
"guide the boat carefully!"
```

The pattern appears in both formal and informal contexts, including ritual
expressions:

```plaintext
'ilitar   venuiteres!
good.SUPE birth.IMP.ABS
"(let) birth be raised in goodness!"
```

### Exclamative Construction

Early Hick marks exclamations through single-word utterances:

1. For actions/verbs, the regular verb form is used:

   ```plaintext
   imris'er!
   flee.VERB!
   "(they're) fleeing!"

   ward'er!
   guide.VERB!
   "(they're) guiding!"
   ```

2. For entities/participants, absolutive marking is used:

   ```plaintext
   im'etiles!
   monster.ABS!
   "a monster!"

   tores!
   mountain.ABS!
   "the mountain!"
   ```

These exclamatives typically express alarm, sudden realization, or strong
emotion, contrasting with regular declarative sentences which use full
argument structure.

## Conjunctions

### Additive Coordination

Early Hick marks coordinated elements with the particle o and joins them with
the coordinator ru (< Proto-Hick *storu "grow"):

```plaintext
kor o toren o ru-el
[cow PART horse PART] AND-ERG
"the cow and horse (as agent)"
```

The coordinator ru can take case marking to show the role of the coordinated
phrase:

- ru-el: coordinated elements as agent
- ru-es: coordinated elements as patient/subject

### Shared Action Coordination

Early Hick can mark joint participation using ewes with the enumeration
particle o:

   ```plaintext
'al'is o Mari o ewes-es ward'er
[person.DEM.PROX.ANIM.VIS PART Mari PART] WITH-ABS travel.VERB
"I and Mari together travel"
```

The coordinator ewes takes case marking and treats the coordinated elements as
a single unit. This construction emphasizes equal participation in the action,
contrasting with the comitative construction where one participant is marked as
primary. See: [Comitative Construction](#comitative-construction).

Note: ewes (< Proto-Hick _ʔelu-lawes "consume with") shows parallel
development with the ergative marker -el, both deriving from Proto-Hick_ʔelu.

### Temporal Coordination

Temporal relationships between clauses use specialized coordinators:

- 'aterbran [ʔa.ter.bran] "before" (lit. "what-flow-dawn")
- 'aterimris [ʔa.te.rim.ris] "after" (lit. "what-flow-from")
- 'atertel [ʔa.ter.tel] "until" (lit. "what-flow-end")
- 'aterter [ʔa.te.ter] "come to pass" (lit. "what-flow-time")

Dependent clauses use nominalized verbs:

```plaintext
[kor o toren o] gras'er-es 'aterimris
[cow PART horse PART] graze-ABS after-ELL
"after the cow and horse grazed"
```

Position affects emphasis:

- Initial: sets temporal frame for discourse
- Final: neutral narrative position

### Causal Subordinator

imris [im.ris] "because" < Proto-Hick \*imeru-ris "towards breath/spirit"

- Functions as a subordinator marking causal relationships
- Grammaticalized from Proto-Hick compound of *imeru "breath/spirit" +*ris
  (LAT)
- Maintains ergative-absolutive alignment in both clauses
- Can appear clause-initially or between clauses
Examples:

```plaintext
imris torthil, 'al'ises barak'er
CAUS haughtiness, person.PROX.ABS walk.VERB
"Because of haughtiness, I walk"

imris ['al'isel ward'er tores], 'al'ises barak'er
CAUS [person.ERG guide.VERB mountain.ABS], person.PROX.ABS walk.VERB
"Because they guide the mountain, I walk"
```

### Concessive Subordinator

las [las] "despite/for all" < Early Hick illative case -las "into"

- Functions as a subordinator marking concessive relationships
- Grammaticalized from spatial case marking inward motion
- Can take both nominal and clausal complements
- Parallels the development of imris

Examples:

```plaintext
las imerlas, 'al'ises tel'es branum
CONC inspiration, person.PROX.ABS empty.ABS PAST
"Despite/For all inspiration, I was empty"

las torthil, 'al'ises barak'er
CONC haughtiness, person.PROX.ABS walk.VERB
"Despite haughtiness, I walk"

las ['al'isel ward'er tores], 'al'ises tel'es branum
CONC [person.ERG guide.VERB mountain.ABS], person.PROX.ABS empty.ABS PAST
"Despite (that) they guide the mountain, I was empty"
```

### Position and Usage

Conjunctions interact with Early Hick's information structure:

1. Can take case marking to show grammatical roles
2. Initial position emphasizes the relationship
3. Final position gives neutral narrative flow
4. With dependent clauses, verbs take nominal form

Examples:

```plaintext
imris toranes ter'er, 'ales barak'er
SUB   river-ABS flow-VERB person-ABS walk-VERB
"Because the river flows, the person walks"

'ales barak'er imris toranes ter'er
person-ABS walk-VERB SUB river-ABS flow-VERB
"The person walks because the river flows"
```

Both imris and las can appear clause-finally, especially in literary contexts
and natural conversation:

```plaintext
'al'ises tel'es branum, imerlas las
person.PROX.ABS empty.ABS PAST, inspiration CONC
"I was empty, despite inspiration"

'al'ises barak'er, ['al'isel ward'er tores] imris
person.PROX.ABS walk.VERB, [person.ERG guide.VERB mountain.ABS] CAUS
"I walk, because they guide the mountain"
```

Note: The same form appears as the ellative case marker -imris, showing parallel
grammaticalization from spatial/directional meaning to both case marking and
subordination.

## Interrogatives

1. Basic Forms

   - 'aka [ʔa.ka] "what"
   - 'alis [ʔa.lis] "who" < 'aka-'al-'is (what-person-PROX.ANIM)
     - Used for visible/known referents and confirmation
   - 'atal [ʔa.tal] "where" < 'aka-tal-is (what-place-PROX.INAN)
   - 'ater [ʔa.ter] "when" < 'aka-ter-is (what-flow-PROX.INAN)
     - Shows temporal metaphor of time as flow
   - 'aker [ʔa.ker] "how" < 'aka-'er-is (what-VERB-PROX.INAN)

2. Medial Forms (Hidden but Sensed)

   - 'akaleth [ʔa.leθ] < 'aka-'al-eth "who" (sensed person)
   - 'akateth [ʔa.teθ] < 'aka-tal-eth "where" (sensed location)
   - 'akatereth [ʔe.te.leθ] < 'aka-ter-eth "when" (sensed time)
   - 'akereth [ʔa.ke.reθ] < 'aka-'er-eth "how" (sensed manner)

   'alis-el materok-es ward-'er?
   who.PROX-ERG boat-ABS guide-VERB
   "Who (that we can see) guides the boat?"

   'aleth-el thral-es his-'er?
   who.MED-ERG ritual-ABS watch-VERB
   "Who (that we can hear/sense) watches the ritual?"

   'atum-aes materok-el rismater-es ward-'er?
   where.DIST-ILL handler-ERG reed.boat-ABS guide-VERB
   "Where (unknown) does the handler guide the reed boat to?"
   ```

5. Semantic Notes

   - Proximal forms: Used for visible/known referents and confirmation
   - Medial forms: Used for sensed but not seen referents (sounds, smells, etc.)
   - Distal forms: Default information-seeking questions about unknowns
   - All forms take regular case marking based on syntactic role
   - Follow standard compound phonology (See:
     [Compound Phonology](#compound-phonology))

See: [Compound Phonology](#compound-phonology) for sound change patterns

## Relative Clauses

Early Hick forms relative clauses using interrogative pronouns as relativizers.
These maintain their proximal/medial/distal distinctions and take case marking
based on their syntactic role within the relative clause.

1. Basic Structure

   ```plaintext
   ['alisel tiraies ter'er] barak'erimris vinudes
   [who.ERG ale.ABS drink.VERB] walk.VERB-ELL dwelling.ABS
   "Who drinks the ale walks home"
   ```

2. Interrogative Forms Used

   - ak "which" (inanimate referents)
   - alis/aleth/alum: "who" (animate referents)
   - atal/ateth/atum: "where" (locations)
   - ater/atereth/aterum: "when" (time)
   - aker/akereth/akerum: "how" (manner)

3. Case Marking

   - Relativizer takes case based on its role in the relative clause
   - Main clause maintains independent case marking

   ```plaintext
   'altanel [alises thren'er] ward'er
   man-MED.VIS.ANIM [who.ABS watch.VERB] guide.VERB
   "That man who watches guides"
   ```

4. Evidentiality Through Distance Forms

   - Proximal (-is): visible/known referents
   - Medial (-eth): sensed but not seen referents
   - Distal (-um): unknown/general referents

   ```plaintext
   ['alumel materokes ward'er] thren'er
   [who.DIST.ERG boat.ABS guide.VERB] watch.VERB
   "Who(ever) guides the boat watches"
   ```

5. Word Order
   - Relative clause typically precedes its head
   - Internal word order follows main clause patterns
   - Spatial case marking on verbs functions normally

# Dialects

## Inland Dialect

### Case Variation

The standard ellative -imris appears as -iter in some inland dialects, showing
older forms preserved away from maritime contact. This explains forms like:

- Standard: vinuimris "to give birth" < vinu-imris "pregnancy-ELL"
- Inland: venuiter "to give birth" < venu-iter "burden-ELL.DIAL"

This dialectal variation is preserved in the formal birthday greeting:

```plaintext
'ilitar venuiteres
good-SUPER birth-ELL.DIAL-ABS
"blessings upon your birth"
```

Note: The greeting preserves the inland dialect form, suggesting its origin in
older agricultural communities before maritime trade influence.

# Development Notes

## Case Development

### Superessive (-itar)

The Early Hick superessive marker -itar derives from Proto-Hick \*ʔita haranu
"above the break/horizon":

1. Initial compound: \*ʔita haranu "above horizon"
2. Fusion and reduction: > \*ʔitharan
3. Grammaticalization: > -itar
   - Loss of final nasal
   - Semantic broadening from "above horizon" to general "upon/above"
   - Shift from independent word to bound morpheme

### Ellative (-imris)

The Early Hick ellative marker -imris derives from Proto-Hick \*imeru-ris
"towards breath/spirit":

1. Initial compound: \*imeru-ris "towards breath"
2. Fusion and reduction: > \*imeris
3. Nasal epenthesis: > -imris
   - Semantic shift from "towards breath" to "outward motion"
   - Parallel development as subordinator "because"
   - Shows common path: body/breath terms → spatial/causal markers

### Subessive (-asam)

The Early Hick subessive marker -asam derives from the noun asam "rest, resting
place" < PH \*xasamu:

1. Original noun: "rest, resting place"
2. Metaphorical extension: "place beneath/under"
3. Grammaticalization: > -asam
   - Semantic broadening from "resting place" to general "under/beneath"
   - Shift from independent noun to bound case marker
   - Shows common path: concrete spatial term → abstract case marker
   - Parallel development in compound vinusam "shoulder" (< \*vinu xasamu "yoke
     rest")
   - Maintains unstressed vowel reduction in both uses

## Development of Demonstratives and Perception Verbs

### Proximal Demonstrative -is and -'is

The Early Hick proximal demonstrative -is and the verb 'is "see" share a common
origin in Proto-Hick \*hisu "visible/in sight":

1. Original PH \*hisu had related meanings:

   - Demonstrative: "this one here (that I can see)"
   - Evidential: "visibly/apparently"
   - Sensory: "sight/vision"

2. Development paths:

   - Demonstrative: \*hisu > -is (PROX.INAN)
   - Animate marker: \*hi-'isu > -'is (PROX.ANIM)
   - Perception: \*hisu > 'is "see"

3. Later developments:
   - Dialectal \*hilis "look" borrowed to disambiguate active perception
   - Original \*his reintroduced as "see" to maintain active/passive distinction
   - Demonstratives -is/-'is retained distinct functions:
     - -is: proximal inanimate ("this thing here")
     - -'is: proximal animate ("this person/animal here")

This explains:

- The formal similarity between demonstratives and perception verbs
- Why there are two demonstrative forms (-is/-'is) with animacy distinction
- The need for dialectal borrowing to maintain semantic distinctions
- The preservation of h- in his/hilis despite normal sound changes

## Development of the Ergative Case Marking -el

The Early Hick ergative marker -el derives from Proto-Hick *ʔelu through
grammaticalization of an instrumental/ablative marker:

1. Sound Changes:
   - *ʔelu >*lu (loss of initial glottal in unstressed position)
   - *lu > -el (vowel change in unstressed position)

2. Functional Development:
   - Original meaning: instrumental/ablative "by means of/from"
   - Intermediate stage: marks agents as instruments of action
   - Final stage: general ergative marker

3. Parallel Developments:
   - Preserved in compound forms like *bahu lu-haranu > bran "branch"
     (literally "split from father")
   - Comitative meaning preserved in ewes < *ʔelu-lawes "together with"

## Development of the Imperative Construction

The Early Hick imperative likely developed from a fuller command construction
with an embedded clause:

1. Original Construction:

   ```plaintext
   'al'isel 'alises command'er [tores threnes] talimris
   person.PROX.ERG who.ABS command.VERB [mountain.ABS watch.ABS] MED.ELL
   "I who command [mountain watching] to you"
   ```

2. Modern Imperative:

   ```plaintext
   tor threndes!
   mountain watch.IMP.ABS
   "watch the mountain!"
   ```

This development explains several features of the modern construction:

- Absolutive marking on the verb (-es) preserves the original nominalized
  action's case
- Unmarked object reflects its position in the original embedded clause
- Word order maintains the original embedded clause structure

The pattern parallels the preserved quotative construction (see:
[Quotative Strategy](#quotative-strategy)), suggesting a common origin for
different command expressions in Early Hick.

## Modal Construction Development

Early Hick shows evidence of modal expressions developing from embedded clause
constructions, with register distinctions preserving both older and
grammaticalized forms. These formal variants make extensive use of relative
clauses (see: [Relative Clauses](#relative-clauses)):

### Commands

Formal/Literary:

```plaintext
'al'isel ['alises command'er tores threnes] talimris
person.ERG [who.ABS command.VERB mountain.ABS watch.ABS] MED.ELL
"I who command mountain-watching to you"
```

Colloquial:

```plaintext
tor threndes!
mountain watch.IMP.ABS
"watch the mountain!"
```

### Desires

Formal/Literary:

```plaintext
'al'isel ['alises gnar'er ward'er] talimris
person.ERG [who.ABS correct.VERB guide.VERB] MED.ELL
"I who intend guiding to you"
```

Colloquial:

```plaintext
'al'isel wardnat
person.ERG guide.DES
"I want to guide"
```

This pattern of preserving older relative clause constructions in formal
registers while using grammaticalized forms in colloquial speech appears to be
a regular feature of Early Hick's historical development. The use of 'alis- as
a relativizer in these formal constructions follows the standard relative
clause pattern.

### Development of Comparative Markers

Proto-Hick *kasu "reflection (on water/mirror surface)" developed into two
distinct but related markers in Early Hick, with one further developing into
the general adjective marker.

#### kas (Comparative Conjunction)

- Direct development from *kasu
- Retains original sense of "mirror/reflection"
- Grammaticalized as comparative conjunction "like/as"
- Used with complex noun phrases: kas [NP] VERB
- Maintains clear scope over entire phrases
- Examples:

  ```plaintext
  kas [kameris kethbranes] tagimris'er
  LIKE [ADJ.love kin.ABS] give.VERB
  "As beloved kin give"
  ```

#### ka- Development Path

1. Early Stage: Comparative Prefix
   - Developed from kas through fusion
   - Used in simple noun comparisons
   - No scope beyond single noun
   - Examples:

     ```plaintext
     kamales ward'er
     ADJ.pool.ABS contain.VERB
     "(It) contains like a pool"
     ```

2. Middle Stage: Similarity Marker
   - Semantic broadening from "like X" to "X-like"
   - Used to mark general similarity
   - Examples:

     ```plaintext
     kakethbran ma'altales
     ADJ.kin person.MED.ABS
     "kin-like people"
     ```

3. Late Stage: Adjective Marker
   - Further grammaticalization into general adjective prefix
   - Marks derived adjectives from nouns
   - Most common use in modern Early Hick
   - Original comparative meaning still visible in some constructions
   - Examples:

      ```plaintext
      kameris ales
      ADJ.love person.ABS
      "beloved person"
      ```

### Development of the possession marker -ul

The Early Hick possessive suffix -ul shows a complex development path from
Proto-Hick *ʔulu:

1. Original Proto-Hick (~800 PF):
   - *ʔulu had three related meanings:
     - "thumb" (concrete body part)
     - "grasp" (physical action)
     - "possession" (abstract relation)

2. Late Proto-Hick (~400 PF):
   - Semantic split occurs:
     - Bare form ulu: "thumb, possession"
     - Locative form ulisu: "grasp" (from *ʔulu-isu)
   - Shows common pattern of using locative case to specify action meanings

3. Early Hick (~100 PF):
   - Further specialization:
     - ul: "thumb" (noun)
     - -ul: possessive marker (grammaticalized from possession meaning)
     - us: "grasp, possession" (from ulisu)

This development explains:

- Why the possessive marker is phonologically identical to "thumb"
- The relationship between ul and us
- The preservation of both concrete and abstract meanings
- The parallel development of possession marking in compounds

The pattern parallels other Early Hick grammaticalizations where body parts
develop into grammatical markers (compare -el ergative < *ʔelu "by means of").
