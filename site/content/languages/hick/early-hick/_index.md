# Overview

The Hick language was the primary tongue of pre-Kalassarian Senera. While no
longer spoken, it survives in place names, maritime terminology, and religious
traditions throughout modern Senera.

A Kalassarian language grammatical sketch of Early and Middle Hick was
unearthed, along with a lexicon was found in an unsealed room underneath the
[Admiralty's Helm](@/locations/admiraltys-helm.md) in
[Surrey-on-the-Brams](@/locations/surrey-on-the-brams.md). Details in this is a
modern analysis of that sketch using modern linguistic methods.

A reconstruction of a hypothetical Proto-Hick is also provided, inferenced from
regional dialects and the historical development of Hick.

# Historical Development

## Early Hick (prehistory to ~300 PF)

- Purely oral tradition
- Core maritime and nature vocabulary established
- Complex compound system develops
- Sacred/ritual terminology crystallizes

## Middle Hick (300 PF to 105 AI)

- More consistent contact with pre-Kalassarian traders
- Maritime trade vocabulary expansion
- Astronomical terminology development
- Sacred site naming conventions formalize
- Initial written forms appear (borrowed script)

## Late Hick/Early Seneran (105 AI to 400 AI)

- Kalassarian settlement period begins
- Administrative terminology adoption
- Initial sound changes:
  - Unstressed vowel reduction begins
  - Compound simplification starts
  - Some liquid deletion word-internally

## Middle Seneran (400 AI to 900 AI)

- Major sound changes:
  - Full unstressed vowel reduction
  - Resyllabification for CV preference
  - Systematic liquid/nasal deletion
  - Stress-related vowel lengthening
- Example: [in.nes.bel] → [i.ne.spel]

## Modern Seneran (900 AI to present)

- Extensive contact with Apgarian kingdoms
- Final changes:
  - Complete syllable restructuring
  - Final cluster simplification
  - Vowel length phonemicization
- Example: [i.ne.spel] → [ine.spell]

# Proto-Hick Reconstruction

## Sound Changes from Proto-Hick to Early Hick

1. Initial *h Development a. Animacy marker *hi-:

   - \*hi- > i- / \_i (before /i/)
   - \*hi- > ʔ- (elsewhere) Examples:
   - \*hi-mer > imer "soul"
   - \*hi-al > ʔal "person"

   b. Sacred marker \*ha-:

   - \*ha- > θ- (th-) Examples:
   - \*halu > hal > thal "holy"
   - \*haru > har > thar "ritual"

2. Final Vowel Loss (Pre-Early Hick)

   - \*-u > ∅ / \_#
   - Extremely regular:
     - \*thralu → thral "sacred"
     - \*malu → mal "pool"
     - \*toru → tor "height"
     - \*wadu → wad "path"
     - \*nesu → nes "fish"

3. Vowel Coalescence (Pre-Early Hick)

   - \*ahi → ai "water"
   - \*grau → gra "grey"

4. Compound-Specific Changes (Early Proto-Hick)

   - Syncope in compounds:
     - \*CVCV-VCV → CCV-VCV
     - \*stenu-alu → stenal → snal
     - \*menu-alu → menal → mnal
   - /r/ dissimilation in compounds:
     - r...r → ∅...r / in compounds
     - \*staru-garu → stargar → sargar
     - \*maru-ris → marris → maris

5. Early Hick Compound Formation Patterns

   - Regular compounding with no changes:
     - mur-mer → murmer "night-bird"
     - mur-kel → murkel "night sky"
     - kur-tin → kurtin "bronze"
   - Liquid/Nasal Deletion in Early Hick compounds:
     - thral-gral → thragral "sacred earth"
     - bram-mal → bramal "tidal pool"
     - val-mal → vamal "spirit pool"
   - Tri-element Compound Simplification (Early Hick innovation):
     - tor-mur-mer → tomur "great owl"
     - thur-mur-mer → thurmur "dusk owl"
     - li-mur-mer → limur "small owl"

6. Initial Cluster Simplification a. \*sC > 'C / #\_ Examples:

   - \*skel > 'kel "opening"
   - \*ster > 'ter "flow"

   b. Medial clusters resyllabified:

   - \*is-kel > [is.kel] "out-sky"
   - \*as-ter > [as.ter] "up-flow"

7. Other Initial Fricative Loss a. \*ʃC > sC / #\_

   - \*ʃkel > skel > 'kel "cave"
   - \*ʃter > ster > 'ter "stream"

   b. \*x > h / #\_

   - \*xalu > halu > al "rock"
   - \*xiru > hiru > ir "iron"

8. Final Vowel Loss
   - \*-u > ∅ / \_#
   - Extremely regular:
     - \*thralu → thral "sacred"
     - \*malu → mal "pool"
     - \*toru → tor "height"
     - \*wadu → wad "path"
     - \*nesu → nes "fish"

## Relative Chronology

1. Pre-Early Hick

   - Final vowel loss (\*-u > ∅)
   - Vowel coalescence (\*ahi > ai)

2. Early Hick Period
   - Productive compound formation
   - Development of compound-specific sound changes
   - Innovation of tri-element compound simplification

## Morphological Evolution

1. Compound Formation Patterns
   - Element + Element preserved from Proto-Hick
   - New patterns developed:
     - Descriptor + Element
     - Location + Base
2. Grammatical Categories
   - Retention of Proto-Hick case system
   - Development of new aspectual markers

## Semantic Shifts

1. Core Vocabulary
   - \*thralu "sacred" → thral "sacred; day"
   - \*kelu "sky" kel "sky; blue"
2. Extended Meanings
   - \*toru "height" → tor- augmentative prefix
   - \*muru "night" → base for owl terminology

## Directional System Development

1. Illative (-aes)
   - From Proto-Hick \*lawes "consume/take in"
   - Sound changes:
     - *lawes > *laes > -aes
   - Parallel development with \*wel > bel "mouth"
   - Original compound: \*wel-lawes "mouth-consume"
     - > *wellaes > *belaes "intake"
     - Grammaticalized to directional marker -aes
2. Ellative (-imris)
   - From compound: *imer "breath" + *is "out"
   - Shows parallel grammaticalization:
     - Body action > directional marker
   - Preserved in forms like:
     - imeraes "inspiration" (soul-inward)
     - imerimris "expression" (soul-outward)
3. Example Usage
   - materok rismateraes kethes "the boatman (goes) into the reed boat"
   - materok rismaterimris kethes "the boatman (goes) out from the reed boat"

## Negation System Development

1. Proto-Hick Stage:
   - *mur "darkness, absence" (full lexical word)
   - Used in compounds to indicate lack/absence
   
2. Early Proto-Hick:
   - *mur becomes preverbal particle marking negation
   - *mur ter "not flow" (lit. "absence flow")
   
3. Late Proto-Hick:
   - Unstressed position leads to reduction:
   - *mur > *mu (liquid deletion in unstressed position)
   
4. Early Hick:
   - Further reduction in unstressed prefix position:
   - *mu- > mo-
   - Examples:
     - mo-thral "non-sacred" < *mur thral
     - mo-ter "not flowing" < *mur ter
     - mo-ward "misdirect" < *mur ward

5. Semantic Development:
   - Original *mur retained independently as "darkness"
   - mo- grammaticalized as general negator
   - Metaphorical extension: darkness → absence → negation

# Phonology

## Overview

Early Hick shows a relatively conservative phonological system inherited from
Proto-Hick, with significant changes occurring mainly in compound formation and
unstressed syllables. See: [Historical Development](#historical-development)

See: [Sound Changes in Compounds](@/languages/hick/early-hick/compounds.md)

### Vowel Sequences

1. Permitted Diphthongs:

   - Within morphemes: /ai/, /ei/, /ae/
   - At morpheme boundaries:
     - /ei-ae/ → [e.e]
     - /ai-ae/ → [ae]
   - No three-vowel sequences

2. Examples:
   - /kei-aes/ → [ke.es] "sky flow"
   - /thrai-aes/ → [thraes] "sacred flow"
   - /brai-aes/ → [braes] "swift flow"

### Weight Distribution Constraints

1. Stress Patterns

   - Primary stress falls on first syllable of simple words
   - In compounds:
     - a. First element maintains primary stress
     - b. Second element reduces unless sacred/ritual term
     - c. Three-element compounds:
       - Primary stress on first element
       - Secondary stress on final element
       - Middle element reduces
   - Exceptions:
     - Sacred/ritual terms resist reduction
     - Maritime terms maintain second element weight
     - Recent compounds may preserve full weight
     - Morphological boundaries may preserve weight

   Examples:

   - 'tor-mal → ['to.məl] "great pool"
   - 'thral-kel → ['θral.kel] "sacred sky" (no reduction - sacred term)
   - 'tor-ma-ˌter → ['tor.mə.ˌter] "great-pool-flow"
   - 'bram-ma-ˌter → ['bram.ma.ˌter] "tide-vessel" (no reduction - maritime)

## Prosodic System

### Stress Patterns

1. Primary Stress
   - Falls on first syllable of root in isolation
   - Maintained in prefixation: 'ma-tor → ['ma.tor]
   - Shifts in compounds: tor-'mal → [tor.'mal]
2. Secondary Stress
   - In three-syllable compounds: 'tor-ma-'ter → ['tor.mə.'ter]
   - In prefix chains: 'ma-ka-'tor → ['ma.kə.'tor]
3. Stress-Related Changes
   - Unstressed /a/ → [ə]
   - Stressed vowels resist reduction
   - Compound stress affects vowel quality

## Compound Phonology

### Sound Changes in Compounds

1. Liquid Deletion

   - tor-mal → tomal "lake"
   - val-mal → vamal "spirit pool"
   - thral-gral → thragral "sacred earth"

2. Nasal Deletion

   - bram-mal → bramal "tidal pool"
   - bran-kel → brakel "morning sky"

3. Vowel Coalescence
   - kei-aes → kees "sky flow"
   - thrai-aes → thraes "sacred flow"

### Compound Types

1. Element + Element

   - kur-tin → kurtin "bronze" (copper-tin)
   - mal-ter → mater "stream" (pool-flow)

2. Descriptor + Element
   - gra-kur → grakur "grey copper"
   - tor-mal → tomal "great pool"

## Allophonic Rules

### Vowel Allophony

The vowel /a/ surfaces as [ə]:

1. After sibilants and affricates:

   - /sak/ → [sək] "wolf"
   - /sal/ → [səl] "stone"

2. After voiceless stops in unstressed syllables:

   - /karan/ → [kərən] "stream"
   - /tamal/ → [təmal] "pool-like"

3. In grammatical prefixes:

   - /ka-/ → [kə-] (similarity prefix)
   - /ma-/ → [mə-] (plural prefix) See:
     [Morphological Prefixes](@/languages/hick/early-hick/morphology.md#prefixes)

4. Between identical consonants:
   - /malam/ → [məlam] "pooled"
   - /ranar/ → [rənər] "flowing"

#### Stress-Dependent Reduction

1. In Compounds:

   - First element maintains stress: 'tor-mal → ['tor.məl]
   - Second element reduced: mal-'ter → [məl.'ter]

2. With Prefixes:

   - Stressed prefix blocks reduction: 'ma-tor → ['ma.tor]
   - Unstressed prefix shows reduction: ka-'tor → [kə.'tor]

3. In Three-syllable Words:
   - Primary stress blocks reduction: 'ka-ra-nal → ['ka.rə.nəl]
   - Secondary stress partially blocks: ˌka-'ra-nal → [ˌka.'ra.nəl]

#### Exceptions

- Maintains [a] in:
  - Stressed syllables
  - Sacred/formal terms
  - Recent compounds See:
    [Sacred Terminology](@/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md#sacred--ritual)

# Morphology

## Overview

Early Hick shows an ergative-absolutive alignment with rich derivational
morphology and a sophisticated spatial reference system. Core grammatical
relations are marked through suffixes, while derivational processes primarily
use prefixes.

## Core Grammar

### Case System

1. Primary Cases

   - -el [el] (ERG): marks agent of transitive verbs
   - -es [es] (ABS): marks patient of transitive & sole argument of intransitive

   Examples:

   ```plaintext
   materok-el ʔal-es ward-ter
   handler-ERG person-ABS direct-to
   "The handler directs the person"

   ʔal-es ter-ʔer
   person-ABS move-ACT
   "The person moves"
   ```

2. Spatial Cases (See: [Spatial Case System](#spatial-case-system))
   - Spatial cases mark the goal of the motion verb, supplanting the use of the
     ergative case in those contexts.
     - -aes (ILL): "inward, into"
     - -imris (ELL): "outward, from"
     - -itar (SUPE): "upward, upon"
     - -esp (SUB): "under, below"
     - -asam (SUBE): "downward, onto"

### Agentive Marking

1. Primary Markers
   - -ok [ok]: forms agent nouns
   - -er [er]: forms active participant nouns Examples:
   - materok "boatman" < mater-ok "vessel-AGENT"
   - ward-er "guide" < ward "direct"

### Tense and Aspect Marking

1. Basic Temporal Markers
   - branum [bra.num] "past" (lit. "swift-that.DIST.INAN")
     - From bran "swift/passing" + -um "distal inanimate"
     - Conceptualizes past as distant/unseen time
   - branrum [bran.rum] "ancestral time" (lit. "swift-that.DIST.ANIM")
     - Uses animate distal marker for sacred/ancestral time
   - mulsum [mul.sum] "future" (lit. "night-change-DIST")
     - From mulsimrum "changes to a distant night"
     - Grammaticalized through reduction: mulsimrum → mulsum
2. Completive Marking
   - tel [tel] "complete, finished"
     - Follows clause for past perfect meaning
     - Example: bramisimris kethes branum tel "the river had flowed to the sea"
3. Position and Usage
   - Can occur sentence-initial (topic/focus):
     - branum bramisimris kethes "In the past, the river flowed to the sea"
     - mulsum bramisimris kethes "In the future, the river will flow to the sea"
   - Can occur sentence-final (neutral):
     - bramisimris kethes branum "The river flowed to the sea"
     - bramisimris kethes mulsum "The river will flow to the sea"
   - Can occur pre-verbal (emphasis):
     - bramisimris branum kethes "The river USED TO flow to sea"
     - bramisimris mulsum kethes "The river WILL flow to sea"

### Spatial Reference System

1. Basic Spatial Markers

   - ran (archaic locative): "at, in"
   - ris (archaic locative): "from, away" Examples:
   - is-ran "at this place"
   - eth-ran "at that place"
   - um-ris "away from that place"

2. Spatial Demonstratives
   - istel-ʔal "this.place-person" (speaker's location)
   - ethtel-ʔal "that.place-person" (addressee's location)
   - umtel-ʔal "far.place-person" (third party location)

### Conjunctions

1. Basic Connectors

   - is "and" (sequential)
   - eth "and" (simultaneous)
   - um "or"

2. Complex Connectors
   - ishis [is.his] "and then"
   - ethis [eθ.is] "while"
   - umis [um.is] "or else"

### Verbal System

1. Basic Verbalizer
   - -ʔer [ʔer]: creates active verbs Examples:
   - ter-ʔer "to flow" (flow-ACT)
   - thral-ʔer "to be sacred" (sacred-ACT)
   - thren-ʔer "to watch" (watch-ACT)

### Spatial Case System

Early Hick's directional system marks the goal of the motion verb, supplanting
the use of the ergative case in those contexts.

1. Basic Directionals
   - -aes: illative "inward, into"
   - -imris: ellative "outward, from"
   - -itar: superessive "upward, upon"
   - -asam: subessive "downward, onto"
   - -esp: sublative "under, below"
   - -sim: translative "change of state, become"
   - Examples:
     - keth-aes "into the sea"
     - keth-imris "from the sea"
     - tor-itar "upward to the peak"
     - tor-asam "downward from the peak"
2. Complex Directionals
   - -aes-imris: translative "change of state, become"
     - formal, reduced to shorter -sim

## Nominal Morphology

### Size and Intensity Markers

1. Diminutive (li-)

   - Prefix meaning "small, lesser"
   - Examples:
     - limal [li.mal] "small pool, pond"
     - liren [li.ren] "small deer, fawn"
     - lines [li.nes] "small fish, minnow"

2. Augmentative (tor-)
   - Prefix meaning "great, mighty" (from "height, peak")
   - Examples:
     - tornes [tor.nes] "great fish, whale"
     - topel [to.pel] "great bear" (tor-pel → topel, liquid deletion)
     - tomal [to.mal] "great pool, lake" (tor-mal → tomal, liquid deletion)
3. Speed Augmentative (tor- -sim)
   - Circumfix combining the argumentative tor- with the translative -sim to
     mean a swift change in speed

### Number Marking

1. Plural Prefix (ma-)
   - Basic plural marker
   - Examples:
     - mator [ma.tor] "peaks, heights"
     - makel [ma.kel] "skies"
   - Interacts with case marking: ma-tor-el (PL-height-ERG)

### Similarity Marking

1. Similarity Prefix (ka-)
   - Prefix meaning "like, similar to"
   - Always surfaces as [kə-] due to regular vowel reduction
   - Examples:
     - ka-tor [kə.tor] "hill-like" (smaller than a mountain)
     - ka-mal [kə.mal] "pond-like" (smaller than a lake)
     - ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)
2. Usage Domains
   - Natural Features: kətor "hill-like", kəmal "pond-like"
   - Animals: kəpel "bear-like", kəmer "bird-like"
   - Body Parts: kəbel "mouth-like", kəven "wing-like"
   - Weather: kəbran "storm-like", kəthral "mist-like"
   - Water Movement: kəran "stream-like", kəthrim "wave-like"
   - Plant Growth: kəthir "grass-like", kəbel "vine-like"
   - Sounds: kəmer "bird-like (sound)", kəsak "wolf-like (howl)"

### Demonstrative System

1. Visible/Known
   - -is [is] "this" (inanimate)
   - -ʔis [ʔis] "this" (animate)
   - -en [en] "that" (inanimate)
   - -tan [tan] "that" (animate)
2. Hidden but Sensed
   - -eth [eθ] "this/that" (inanimate)
   - -thir [θir] "this/that" (animate)
3. Distant/Out of Sight
   - -um [um] "that" (inanimate)
   - -rum [rum] "that" (animate)

### Personal Reference

1. Spatial Demonstratives
   - istel-ʔal "this.place-person" (speaker's location)
   - ethtel-ʔal "that.place-person" (addressee's location)
   - umtel-ʔal "far.place-person" (third party location)

### Negation System

1. Basic Negation
   - mo- [mo]: general negation prefix Examples:
     - mo-thral "non-sacred, profane"
     - mo-ter "not flowing, stagnant"
     - mo-ward "misdirect, lead astray"

### Possession Marking

1. Basic Possession
   - -ok [ok]: possessive suffix Examples:
   - mater-ok "vessel owner"
   - thral-ok "ritual keeper"

## Verbal Morphology

### Verbalizer

- -ʔer [ʔer]: creates active verbs Examples:
- ter-ʔer "to flow" (flow-ACT)
- thral-ʔer "to be sacred" (sacred-ACT)
- thren-ʔer "to watch" (watch-ACT)

### Directional System

1. Basic Directionals

   - -aes: illative "inward, into"
   - -imris: ellative "outward, from"
   - -itar: superlative "upward"
   - -asam: sublative "downward"

2. Example Usage

   - materokel rismateraes "the boatman enters the reed boat"
   - materokel rismaterimris "the boatman exits the reed boat"
   - materokel rismateritar "the boatman climbs onto the reed boat"
   - materokel rismaterasam "the boatman climbs down from the reed boat"

3. Notes:
   - Directional cases imply motion verbs
   - Ergative (-el) marks the agent
   - No additional case marking needed on the goal/source when using
     directionals

## Adjectival Morphology

Early Hick has no true adjective class. Quality concepts are expressed through:

1. Stative Verbs
   - Uses verbalizer -ʔer
   - Takes absolutive argument
   Examples:
   - kel-es kakel'er "sky-ABS blue.VERB" (the sky is blue)
   - thral-el kel-es kakel'er "ritual-ERG sky-ABS blue.VERB" 
     (the ritual makes the sky blue)

2. Change of State
   1. Translative (-sim):
      keles kakelsim
      sky.ABS blue.TRANS
      "sky becomes blue" (general change of state)

      thralel kakelsim keles
      ritual.ERG blue.TRANS sky.ABS
      "ritual makes sky blue" (caused change)

   2. Directional Cases (-aes/-imris):
      kamar keles kakelaes
      red sky.ABS blue.ILL
      "red sky turns blue" (movement toward state)

      kakel keles kamarimris
      blue sky.ABS red.ELL
      "blue sky turns back red" (return to state)

3. Notes:
   - No attributive modification
   - All qualities are verbal predicates
   - Follows ergative-absolutive alignment
   - Causatives marked by adding ergative agent


## Derivational Morphology

### Similarity Prefix

- ka- [kə]: prefix meaning "like, similar to"
- Always surfaces as [kə-] due to regular vowel reduction Examples:
- ka-tor [kə.tor] "hill-like" (smaller than a mountain)
- ka-mal [kə.mal] "pond-like" (smaller than a lake)
- ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)

### Negation System

- mo- [mo]: general negation prefix Examples:
- mo-thral "non-sacred, profane"
- mo-ter "not flowing, stagnant"
- mo-ward "misdirect, lead astray"

### Compound Formation

- Basic Pattern: modifier-head
- Sound changes:
  - Liquid deletion: tor-mal → tomal
  - Nasal deletion: bram-mal → bramal Examples:

## Affix Order

### Basic Template

1. Root Structure

   - (PREFIX*) + ROOT + (SUFFIX*)
   - Maximum of three prefixes and two suffixes

2. Order of Elements

```plaintext
(NEG)-(SIZE)-(SIM)-ROOT-(AGENT)-(CASE)

```

Examples:

- mo-tor-el (NEG-height-ERG) "not the height (as agent)"
- li-ka-mal-ok-es (DIM-SIM-pool-AGENT-ABS) "small pool-like keeper (as patient)"
- tor-ka-mal-el (AUG-SIM-pool-ERG) "great pool-like thing (as agent)"

### Prefix Classes

1. Outer Prefixes (first position)
   - mo- (NEG): negation
   - ma- (PL): plural
2. Middle Prefixes (second position)
   - tor- (AUG): augmentative
   - li- (DIM): diminutive
3. Inner Prefixes (closest to root)
   - ka- (SIM): similarity
   - is- (PROX): proximate
   - eth- (MED): medial
   - um- (DIST): distal

### Suffix Classes

1. Inner Suffixes (closer to root)

   - -ok (AGENT): agentive
   - -er (ACT): active participant

2. Outer Suffixes (final position)
   - -el (ERG): ergative case
   - -es (ABS): absolutive case
   - -imris (ELL): ellative case
   - -aes (ILL): illative case

### Restrictions

1. Co-occurrence

   - Only one prefix from each position class
   - Maximum of one case suffix
   - Agent suffix must precede case suffix

2. Phonological Interactions
   - Prefix ka- always reduces to [kə-]
   - Liquid deletion applies across morpheme boundaries
   - Nasal deletion applies across morpheme boundaries


## Nominal Morphology

### Size and Intensity Markers

1. Diminutive (li-)

   - Prefix meaning "small, lesser"
   - Examples:
     - limal [li.mal] "small pool, pond"
     - liren [li.ren] "small deer, fawn"
     - lines [li.nes] "small fish, minnow"

2. Augmentative (tor-)
   - Prefix meaning "great, mighty" (from "height, peak")
   - Examples:
     - tornes [tor.nes] "great fish, whale"
     - topel [to.pel] "great bear" (tor-pel → topel, liquid deletion)
     - tomal [to.mal] "great pool, lake" (tor-mal → tomal, liquid deletion)
3. Speed Augmentative (tor- -sim)
   - Circumfix combining the argumentative tor- with the translative -sim to
     mean a swift change in speed

### Number Marking

1. Plural Prefix (ma-)
   - Basic plural marker
   - Examples:
     - mator [ma.tor] "peaks, heights"
     - makel [ma.kel] "skies"
   - Interacts with case marking: ma-tor-el (PL-height-ERG)

### Similarity Marking

1. Similarity Prefix (ka-)
   - Prefix meaning "like, similar to"
   - Always surfaces as [kə-] due to regular vowel reduction
   - Examples:
     - ka-tor [kə.tor] "hill-like" (smaller than a mountain)
     - ka-mal [kə.mal] "pond-like" (smaller than a lake)
     - ka-bram [kə.bram] "tide-like" (rhythmic movement)
2. Usage Domains
   - Natural Features: kətor "hill-like", kəmal "pond-like"
   - Animals: kəpel "bear-like", kəmer "bird-like"
   - Body Parts: kəbel "mouth-like", kəven "wing-like"
   - Weather: kəbran "storm-like", kəthral "mist-like"
   - Water Movement: kəran "stream-like", kəthrim "wave-like"
   - Plant Growth: kəthir "grass-like", kəbel "vine-like"
   - Sounds: kəmer "bird-like (sound)", kəsak "wolf-like (howl)"

### Demonstrative System

1. Visible/Known
   - -is [is] "this" (inanimate)
   - -ʔis [ʔis] "this" (animate)
   - -en [en] "that" (inanimate)
   - -tan [tan] "that" (animate)
2. Hidden but Sensed
   - -eth [eθ] "this/that" (inanimate)
   - -thir [θir] "this/that" (animate)
3. Distant/Out of Sight
   - -um [um] "that" (inanimate)
   - -rum [rum] "that" (animate)

### Personal Reference

1. Spatial Demonstratives
   - istel-ʔal "this.place-person" (speaker's location)
   - ethtel-ʔal "that.place-person" (addressee's location)
   - umtel-ʔal "far.place-person" (third party location)

### Negation System

1. Basic Negation
   - mo- [mo]: general negation prefix Examples:
     - mo-thral "non-sacred, profane"
     - mo-ter "not flowing, stagnant"
     - mo-ward "misdirect, lead astray"

### Possession Marking

1. Basic Possession
   - -ok [ok]: possessive suffix Examples:
   - mater-ok "vessel owner"
   - thral-ok "ritual keeper"

## Verbal Morphology

### Verbalizer

- -ʔer [ʔer]: creates active verbs Examples:
- ter-ʔer "to flow" (flow-ACT)
- thral-ʔer "to be sacred" (sacred-ACT)
- thren-ʔer "to watch" (watch-ACT)

### Directional System

1. Basic Directionals

   - -aes: illative "inward, into"
   - -imris: ellative "outward, from"
   - -itar: superlative "upward"
   - -asam: sublative "downward"

2. Example Usage

   - materokel rismateraes "the boatman enters the reed boat"
   - materokel rismaterimris "the boatman exits the reed boat"
   - materokel rismateritar "the boatman climbs onto the reed boat"
   - materokel rismaterasam "the boatman climbs down from the reed boat"

3. Notes:
   - Directional cases imply motion verbs
   - Ergative (-el) marks the agent
   - No additional case marking needed on the goal/source when using
     directionals

## Derivational Morphology

### Similarity Prefix

- ka- [kə]: prefix meaning "like, similar to"
