_Proto-Hick_ is a hypothetical reconstructed language that represents the
ancestral language of the Hickic languages.

The current state of its reconstruction is highly speculative, as all evidence
are from only one line of descent: Early Hick. There are plans to document more
Seneran dialects to increase the robustness of the reconstruction. There may be
some evidence that Sanerian languages and dialects may be related to Hickic, but
more research is needed to confirm this.

# Proto-Hick Phonology

## Overview

Proto-Hick shows a simpler phonological system than Early Hick, with strict
(C)CV(C) syllable structure and obligatory onsets (filled by glottal stop if no
other consonant).

## Phonotactics

### Syllable Structure

1. Basic Pattern: (C)CV(C)

   - Initial C required (ʔ if no other consonant)
   - No complex onsets or codas
   - Final C optional

2. Examples:
   - \*ʔahi "water"
   - \*muru "night"
   - \*telu "place"
   - \*ʔimru "evil"

### Stress Pattern

- Fixed initial stress
- No vowel reduction
- All vowel qualities preserved in all positions

### Phonological Processes

1. Obligatory Onset:

   - Ø → ʔ / #\_V
   - Examples:
     - *ahi → *ʔahi "water"
     - *imru → *ʔimru "group, party"

2. Final Vowels:
   - Preserved in all positions
   - Most commonly _-u, _-a
   - Rare \*-i in some forms

# Reconstructed Features

## Sound Changes from Proto-Hick to Early Hick

1. Initial *h Development a. Animacy marker *hi-:

   - \*hi- > i- / \_i (before /i/)
   - \*hi- > ʔ- (elsewhere) Examples:
   - \*hi-mer > imer "soul"
   - \*hi-al > ʔal "person"

   b. Sacred marker \*ha-:

   - \*ha- > θ- (th-) Examples:
   - \*halu > θal "holy"
   - \*haru > θar "ritual"

2. Dental Fricative Development a. Before non-high vowels - fusion path:

   - Vt.hV > t.hV > thV > θV Examples:
   - *et.hal > *t.hal > \*thal > θal "that"
   - *ut.har > *t.har > \*thar > θar "there"

   b. Before high vowels - aspiration path:

   - Vt.hH > t.hH > thH > tʰH > tH (where H = high vowel, aspiration
     non-contrastive) Examples:
   - *et.his > *t.his > \*this > tis "here"
   - *ut.hir > *t.hir > \*thir > tir "person"

3. Final Vowel Loss (Pre-Early Hick)

   - \*-u > ∅ / \_# Examples:
   - \*thralu → thral "sacred"
   - \*malu → mal "pool"
   - \*toru → tor "height"

4. Vowel Coalescence (Pre-Early Hick)

   - \*ahi → \*aʱi → ai "water" (through breathy voice intermediate)
   - \*grau → gra "grey"

   Note: The breathy voice stage (\*aʱi) may be significant for understanding
   dialectal developments, though direct evidence is limited to Early Hick.

5. Compound-Specific Changes (Early Proto-Hick)

   - Syncope in compounds:
     - \*CVCV-VCV → CCV-VCV
     - \*stenu-alu → stenal → snal
     - \*menu-alu → menal → mnal
   - /r/ dissimilation in compounds:
     - r...r → ∅...r / in compounds
     - \*staru-garu → stargar → sargar
     - \*maru-ris → marris → maris

6. Early Hick Compound Formation Patterns

   - Regular compounding with no changes:
     - mur-mer → murmer "night-bird"
     - mur-kel → murkel "night sky"
     - kur-tin → kurtin "bronze"
   - Liquid/Nasal Deletion in Early Hick compounds:
     - thral-gral → thragral "sacred earth"
     - bram-mal → bramal "tidal pool"
     - val-mal → vamal "spirit pool"
   - Tri-element Compound Simplification (Early Hick innovation):
     - tor-mur-mer → tomur "great owl"
     - thur-mur-mer → thurmur "dusk owl"
     - li-mur-mer → limur "small owl"

7. Initial Cluster Simplification a. \*sC > 'C / #\_ Examples:

   - \*skel > 'kel "opening"
   - \*ster > 'ter "flow"

   b. Medial clusters resyllabified:

   - \*is-kel > [is.kel] "out-sky"
   - \*as-ter > [as.ter] "up-flow"

8. Other Initial Fricative Loss a. \*ʃC > sC / #\_

   - \*ʃkel > skel > 'kel "cave"
   - \*ʃter > ster > 'ter "stream"

   b. \*x > h / #\_

   - \*xalu > halu > al "rock"
   - \*xiru > hiru > ir "iron"

9. Final Vowel Loss
   - \*-u > ∅ / \_#
   - Extremely regular:
     - \*thralu → thral "sacred"
     - \*malu → mal "pool"
     - \*toru → tor "height"
     - \*wadu → wad "path"
     - \*nesu → nes "fish"

## Proto-Hick Features

### Animacy Marking

1. Proto-Hick \*hi- prefix

   - Marked animate/personified entities
   - Two development paths:
     - a. *hi- > i- / \_i (before high vowels)
     - b. *hi- > ʔ- (elsewhere)

1. Examples of \*hi- > i-:

   - \*hi-mer > imer "soul, living breath"
   - \*hi-mur > imur "evil force"
   - \*hi-skel > iskel "window" (personified sky-opening)

2. Examples of \*hi- > ʔ-:

   - \*hi-al > ʔal "person"
   - \*hi-ok > ʔok "keeper, guardian"
   - \*hi-er > ʔer "doer, actor"

3. Contrast with non-animate forms:
   - \*mer > mer "breath" (physical)
   - \*mur > mur "darkness" (abstract)
   - \*skel > skel "opening" (physical)

## Relative Chronology

1. Pre-Early Hick

   - Final vowel loss (\*-u > ∅)
   - Vowel coalescence (\*ahi > ai)

2. Early Hick Period
   - Productive compound formation
   - Development of compound-specific sound changes
   - Innovation of tri-element compound simplification

## Morphological Evolution

1. Compound Formation Patterns
   - Element + Element preserved from Proto-Hick
   - New patterns developed:
     - Descriptor + Element
     - Location + Base
2. Grammatical Categories
   - Retention of Proto-Hick case system
   - Development of new aspectual markers

## Semantic Shifts

1. Core Vocabulary
   - \*thralu "sacred" → thral "sacred; day"
   - \*kelu "sky" kel "sky; blue"
   - \*sedu-lawesu "seed-consume" → duwes "eat/consume"
   - Sound changes:
     - Liquid deletion at morpheme boundary
     - Syncope in first element
     - Initial cluster simplification
     - Vowel coalescence
     - Final vowel loss
   - Related forms:
     - \*sedu "seed"
     - \*lawesu "consume"
2. Extended Meanings
   - \*toru "height" → tor- augmentative prefix
   - \*muru "night" → base for owl terminology

## Directional System Development

1. Illative (-aes)
   - From Proto-Hick \*lawes "consume/take in"
   - Sound changes:
     - *lawes > *laes > -aes
   - Parallel development with \*wel > bel "mouth"
   - Original compound: \*wel-lawes "mouth-consume"
     - > *wellaes > *belaes "intake"
     - Grammaticalized to directional marker -aes
2. Ellative (-imris)
   - From compound: *imer "breath" + *is "out"
   - Shows parallel grammaticalization:
     - Body action > directional marker
   - Preserved in forms like:
     - imeraes "inspiration" (soul-inward)
     - imerimris "expression" (soul-outward)
3. Example Usage
   - materok rismateraes kethes "the boatman (goes) into the reed boat"
   - materok rismaterimris kethes "the boatman (goes) out from the reed boat"

## Negation System Development

1. Proto-Hick Stage:
   - \*mur "darkness, absence" (full lexical word)
   - Used in compounds to indicate lack/absence
2. Early Proto-Hick:
   - \*mur becomes preverbal particle marking negation
   - \*mur ter "not flow" (lit. "absence flow")
3. Late Proto-Hick:
   - Unstressed position leads to reduction:
   - *mur > *mu (liquid deletion in unstressed position)
4. Early Hick:

   - Further reduction in unstressed prefix position:
   - \*mu- > mo-
   - Examples:
     - mo-thral "non-sacred" < \*mur thral
     - mo-ter "not flowing" < \*mur ter
     - mo-ward "misdirect" < \*mur ward

5. Semantic Development:
   - Original \*mur retained independently as "darkness"
   - mo- grammaticalized as general negator
   - Metaphorical extension: darkness → absence → negation

# Sample Proto-Hick Resconstructions

## Proto-Hick \*muruhilisu

1. Etymology: Compound of *muru "night" + *hi-lisu "see" (animate prefix +
   "eye")
2. Development:

   - *muruhilisu > *murhilisu (syncope)
   - > \*murlisu (compound reduction)
   - > mulis (Early Hick, final vowel loss)

3. Semantic Development:
   - Literal: "night-seeing"
   - Extended: "dream, vision"
   - Related forms:
     - \*muru "night"
     - \*hi-lisu "to see" (animate)
     - \*lisu "eye" (physical organ)
