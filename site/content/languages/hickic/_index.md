The Hick language family is a group of related languages spoken in Senera. By
the time of the Fall of the Kalassarian Empire, the Hick languages were
supplanted by Classical Kalassarian. However, even during this time, local
speakers of Hick languages continued to use their languages in everyday life.

# Hick Sub-Families

## Seneran Hick

Seneran Hick considered the typifying language of the Hick family. The languages
of the Seneran Hick family are spoken in the main Seneran Island, and are the
substrates of the modern Seneran language.

## Maritime/Straits Hick

This sub-family are a variety of languages spoken in the islands of the Princely
Straits. They include Palman, the language of Racos Palma, Sentimental Island
and Shagnery, and Moreaux.

As the prehistoric Hickic people expanded westward, their relative distance from
the Apgarian mainland began to affect their language. These island-bound
cultures still maintained a close linguistic relationship with each other, but
had started to diverge from those mainland languages. Languages that are said to
derive from Proto-Maritime Hick are the extinct Raibonian, Sentimental, and
Palman.

Some proposed sound changes from Proto-Hick to Proto-Maritime Hick are:

1. Deletion of a liquid in proximity to a glottal fricative:

   ```txt
   h [liquid] => h \*/ \_
   - [liquid] h => \* h /\_
   ```

2. Reanalysis of initial ha to match changes with sacred terminology:

   ```txt
   ha => θə / $ _ {[stop !glottal], [fricative], [liquid], [glide]}  
   ```

   This change may explain why Kalassarian sources sometimes transcribe Hausi as
   "Mausi/Mauri" - the heavily aspirated initial /h/ in Maritime Hick dialects
   likely had strong nasalization, leading Kalassarian speakers to perceive it
   as /m/. This is particularly evident in coastal varieties where contact was
   most frequent.

## Apgarian Hick

It is widely debated whether or not the Apgarian Hick languages have diverged
directly from a hypothetical Proto-Hick, or whether they are instead a
descendant of one of the variants of Straits Hick. The fact that modern
descendants of Apgarian Hick are heavily influenced by Kalassarian, and have
continuous contact with Straits Hick languages as well as the surrounding
Apgarian languages, makes it difficult to determine the historical relationship
between the two groups.
