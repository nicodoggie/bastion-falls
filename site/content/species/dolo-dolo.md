# Dolo-Dolo

The Dolo-Dolo are a race of magically-enhanced humanoids found primarily in the Forest region of Sorha, but
do exist elsewhere in the [Ralakan continent](@/locations/ralaka/index.md). They are an intelligent, but highly traditional 
and ritualistic people whose lives revolve around the protection and stabilization of their tribes. There are said 
to be 7 main tribes in power within the Forest region of Sorha, and have a cultural divide that is, as delineated
by many of the Dolo-Dolo themselves, as the Eastern and Western tribes. These groupings are defined by 
which side of the [Stairway to the Heavens](@/locations/stairway-to-the-heavens) their ancestral lands lie upon.

Historical references to the Dolo-Dolo were put in question by many modern scholars of Ahurian history prior to the 
Fall of Burtz. They surmise that most of these histories and records were semi-mythical, whose sources were colored
by a certain historiographical tradition that ascribed unexplained events or perceptions to popular theological references.
In these cases, historians believed that Dolo-Dolo sightings were used to explain strange sightings within forest regions
due to the popularity of the [Tale of the Great Ahuriyata and the Dolo-Dolo Trickster](@/misc/ahuriyata-and-the-trickster.md). They offer as proof the virtual
disappearance of Dolo-Dolo sightings and references after 700 AI. Of course, recent events around the world, where peoples once
considered mythological have begun to surface, especially actual tribes in Sorha who call themselves the Dolo-Dolo have renewed
interest in re-examining these histories and called into question the historiographical theories on the subject.

## Mythology

### Ahurian Tradition

Most Ahurians have only heard of the Dolo-Dolo through the Tale of the Great Ahuriyata and the Dolo-Dolo Trickster.
  Some variations of the tale exist, as it was conveyed orally by many a tavern performer within Ahuria's centuries
of dominance in the Ralakan continent. It tells the story of how the Great Ahuriyata had first traveled through the 
Forests of Sorha in search of the mountain the Stairway to the Heavens would eventually be founded upon. Within
that forest, there was a mysterious creature that seemed to stalk the Great Ahuriyata, with the intention of 
eating him for dinner. 

The Great Ahuriyata, of course, was too cunning himself, and was too wily for the Dolo-Dolo's
trickery, and was, instead able to fool him. However, when the Great Ahuriyata was about to leave the forest,
the Dolo-Dolo was caught in a monster's snare. The Great Ahuriyata saves him from his plight, Extremely grateful
for the kindness that he was showed even after the Dolo-Dolo's attempt at trickery, he pledged his everlasting
support to the Ahuriyata and his kin.

### Dolomite Tradition

The Dolo-Dolo of Sorha have a similar tale that is passed down from generation, but the trickery is played out by the adversary of the Dolo-Dolo religion--Herasi the Deceitful. Herasi was a spiteful character that did ill to random individuals who may have entered, supposedly without permission, in land that he wrongfully claims as his. So as the Great Ahuriyata entered the Forest of the Dolo-Dolo, Herasi takes the face of a Dolo-Dolo female in distress to lure the renowned hero into a trap.

The Ahuriyata falls for the deception after a very convincing performance. Before Herasi was able to land the final blow however, a Dolo-Dolo tribesman and his child stumbled upon the scene. With their> spears, they drove the Deceitful One away. 

Now the Dolo-Dolo tribesman, whose name and lineage differ depending upon the tribe telling the tales, came from an impoverished tribe on the brink of starvation due to a famine induced by the very same Herasi. They feared that Herasi would now punish them even more after exposing his true form the the erstwhile interloper that entered the Deceitful One's territory. The Ahuriyata, grateful from the help he just received, and angry for the suffering that Herasi had set upon these good people, decided to help them thwart the Deceitful One once and for all.

They enact an elaborate plan to lure Herasi into their encampment, offering a young face and form that suits the trickster's preference. His current body was at this point turning quite old and frail, so the replacement was a welcome one. Unbeknown to Herasi, the Great Ahuriyata was already lying in wait by the time he entered the young man's home. The Great Ahuriyata then springs into action and reveals his trap--a gigantic black-green orb that is capable of binding creatures of magic such as he within it; To this day, this giant, yet seemingly inert Attractor, sits dormant underneath the Dolomite Mountains. 

Some traditions surmise that once the Mother of Orbs escapes its prison, it would allow the sphere they call the
Orb of Binding to feed upon that larger, more directed source of magic and free Herasi to commit his crimes once more.

## History

Evidence suggests that the Dolo-Dolo were the first settlers of the Ralakan Continent. Earliest fossils of
Dolo-Dolo settlements were found in the Purha area. Within 100,000 years, they would have settlements found all over the continent up to present-day Pise.

Fragments of Kureran thought-records excavated from Mehicania date some of the earliest interactions with the Dolo-Dolo at present-day Sorha went back to at least 950 PF. The recording was of an explorer following one of the rivers, possibly the Tamisami River that runs through the entirety of the Forest region, was rescued by a band of Dolo-Dolo foragers. This remains, to this day, the most extensive ethnography of the Dolo-Dolo. The "thought" from the Kureran thought-recording detailed the initial encounter, their language at the time, and their cultural and technological capabilities. The insight it offered, was that the Dolo-Dolo was not the typical primitive hunter-gatherer. Instead, they had sophisticated techniques that favored a type of subsistence farming that ensured that they had as little an impact to the ecology surrounding them as possible.

Recordings from Old Ahurian sources included similar information years later, but without the level of technical understanding that the Kurerans were able to detail in their account. It is notable, however, that the Old Ahurian recording was roughly 1,000 years after the former recordings, and recent analysis would indicate that the ethnographical details were largely identical. 

After 500 AI, references to Dolo-Dolo dwindled to almost nothing, coinciding with a global trend of a diminishing number of historical manuscripts related to extra-human abilities and races. Any remaining references to them are fictional, religious or allegorical in nature instead. It is now widely believed that the reason for this global trend has something to do with the disappearance of magical energy from the world. Since there was little to no more latent magical energy in the atmosphere, extra-human creatures stopped being born. Eventually the remaining extant populations died out in a few generations. After a few more, living memory of creatures like the Dolo-Dolo likely disappeared, and had been consigned to myth.

It is disputed, however, that the Dolo-Dolo died out and reborn in the style of the Verdines and the Cornups. The fact that the most recent reports of Dolo-Dolo communities are consistent with centuries-old records. While some scholars believe that this might mean that many of their cultural habits and mores are instinctual, others yet believe that they did not die out at all, and have survived in some form throughout the centuries. The debate is still open on this point, and may only be settled after a lengthy anthropological investigation.
## Ethnography

Dolo-Dolo do not have a similar agriculture to the typical human style. They developed techniques that involve stimulating plant growth with various non-invasive fertilization and irrigation strategies. They planted roots, shrubs and trees in accordance to known growth rates and their community's consumption. They were aware of growing seasons, but they did not make large-scale farms, nor did they domesticate cultivars of common staples. Instead, they have simply "helped" natural growth of flora in their general vicinity. Sorha itself was plentiful enough that they did not need to live as more typical hunter-gatherers do and roam a wide area throughout a season, instead, they tailored their diet to what was available in a season. 

In addition, they had a magical tradition similar to those of Druids. Since, however, most Dolo-Dolo already use most of the magical energy they process internally to sustain their large bodies, they have learned to use the Orbs of EnhRulesancement that naturally form in the caverns underneath the Sorhan mountain ranges to help with variations in growth conditions and disease control. 

Dolo-Dolo hunting was very ritualistic and self-sustaining. They only hunted certain species of deer, buffalo and pheasant in appropriate seasons, and only those who have grown to a certain size and age. This ensured that they would not reduce their population potential. The only animal they ever domesticated, were a variety of Tahusa Valley horse that were able to subsist on a very prolific variety of wild oat.  

Dolo-Dolo homes were built close together, from wood cut deliberately in a ritualistic manner and only under certain conditions. Then the wood is then processed into 2"x2" pieces of lumber. A rectangular hole is then dug into the ground roughly the size of the dwelling. After which, four poles are driven about half a foot diagonally from each corner of the hole. Two rows of lumber are then placed in parallel to each other against the poles on opposing sides. The distance of each pole is most often spaced slightly less than the length of the pieces of lumber used. Above, two more parallel pieces are placed perpendicular to the first layer, this is repeated until a structure of about a height of 7 feet is made. Appropriate gaps for a doorway is left, often facing the direction of the rising sun. Logs are then placed in an octagon shape on top, with a smaller diameter each level, until only a 1'x1' gap is left. Clay is packed to cover the wooden frame and roofing. A hollow log is placed in the middle of the gap as a chimney stack, and is held in place with the clay. Finally, the structure is left to dry in the sun until it hardens. Proximity of each dwelling is dependent on the family unit.

### Rites of Hospitality

### Martial Traditions

In the earliest days of the interactions between the Dolo-Dolo and the Kurerans, the intelligent, gentle giants of the Ralakan contintent did not have need to field and train large armies from its ranks, or train in a formalized style of fighting. The Dolo-Dolo tribes were rarely in conflict with each other for too long. Since the forests were plentiful, and the mountains dispensed means of easing the world's random ills, they aren't pushed by the typical troubles of famine and pestilence. They welcome death as a dear friend, as most die of old age and weariness instead of pain and disease. That was, until other peoples and races have discovered their lands, and the riches they contained. 

### Rite of Satisfaction

Traditionally, the Dolo-Dolo settled conflicts and aggression among themselves by invoking the **Rite of Satisfaction**. It is a ritualized dispute resolution mechanism where parties involved may choose one willing and able champion to fight to the death for their cause. It was to signify that they were willing to defend their argument to the death. If one party chooses to yield the argument, they would be allowed to live, but at the cost of their reputation. Their belief is that one who invokes the rite must have made the effort to truly believe in the truth of their cause that they would be willing to die for it, and yielding proves that they, in fact, do not have that confidence regarding the weight of their argument, and that they were foolish enough to only see through their error at risk of death.

There were only a few rules in the performance of a Rite of Satisfaction. All parties must agree with the following rules and stipulations:
  1. That the source of conflict was deemed irreconcilable by non-violent means
  2. That all effort had been exhausted in the attempt of resolving the conflict by those means 
  3. That parties involved must understand the implications of the Rite of Satisfaction. 
  4. That parties must agree upon a boon to be given to the winning party. 
  5. That arms or spells which affect the opposing forces' state of mind are prohibited.
  6. That arms or spells which might cause harm outside the parties involved are prohibited.
  7. That arms or spells which allow travel beyond the bounds of the rite are prohibited.
  8. That once a champion yells "yield", the rite has ended. Any violence after will no longer have the protection of the rite.
  9. That the results of the Rite of Satisfaction must be honored by all parties, and the boon be rightfully awarded to the winner.2
  10. Further dispute on the matter, with the exact same parties involved can no longer invoke the Rite of Satisfaction, as a parties involved should have already been satisfied.
  12. Death be to those that cause harm regarding the matter after satisfaction had been granted. 

The ritual surrounding the Rite of Satisfaction slightly vary between tribes, but remain fairly similar throughout. The traditions of the most ascendant of the tribes involved take precedence if they are involved and are not one of the parties to invoke it.
