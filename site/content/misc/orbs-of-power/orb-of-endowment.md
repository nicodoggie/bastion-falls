Orbs of Endowment are smooth spherical pearlescent objects that emit a bright
white light. These so-called "bestower orbs" endow a person with little or no
access to the raw magic of Thera with a small amount of magical energy.

# Effects

Possession of an orb of endowment will grant the bearer enough magical energy to
attune to magical items.

The magically-adept may use bestower orbs as stores of magical energy or
pre-prepared spells.
