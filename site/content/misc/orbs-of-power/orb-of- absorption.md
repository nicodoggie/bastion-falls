Orbs of Absorption are smooth spherical objects that emit a uniform yellow
light. These so-called "absorber orbs" siphon away magical energy from a nearby
entity, and disperse that energy into the surrounding area.

Larger absorber orbs can even have an effect on their other innate mental
attributes, such as their emotions, intelligence, and core memories.
