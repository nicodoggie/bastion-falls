Orbs of Repulsion are smooth black spherical objects that emit a red light.
These "repeller orbs" expel natural stores of magical energy from an entity.

Repeller orbs are naturally found in the same deposits as enhancement orbs,
however there are only 1 repeller for every 100 enhancers.

# Effects

At a certain radius proportional to the volume of the orb, any and all magic
will not work. They act similarly to the spell
{{ spell(name="Antimagic Field") }}, but seemingly without the same time limits
associated with that spell.
