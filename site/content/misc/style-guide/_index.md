The creation of this website predates any urge to have a consistent style. The primary author realizes now that this may pose issues with clarity, and thus from the publication of this article, the author would strive to conform the the guidelines specified in this document. Once time warrants, the author wills strive to update the rest of the site to conform to this guide. 

As this website describes characters, locations and other details about a setting for the fifth edition Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Game called Bastion Falls, this guide uses the *D&D Style Guide*[^1] as a primary resource when referring to elements of the game. The aformentioned guide also cites the *Chicago Manual of Style 17th edition* for stylistic guidance, which will be conformed to on a best-effort basis. 

# Updates to the Style Guide

Finalized updates to the Style Guide will be noted by a *tag* within the website's *git repository* with the format *style-guide/<version>*, where the *version* is a string conforming to the *Semantic Versioning 2.0.0* specification[^2].
