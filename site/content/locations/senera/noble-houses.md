## House Surrata (c. 500 AI - Present) {#house-surrata}

The coastal domain of the Inespell Gulf had been held by House Surrata since the
Fall of Western Kalassar. They have been instrumental in the rise to power of
the Maidenfeld Dynasty. After the dust had settled, the Maidenfeld monarch had
designated the entirety of the gulf as a march under the authority of the first
Marcher Lord of Surrey.

After the War of Thyme and Fire, the Dragonhearts wanted to ensure that the
powerful House Surrata was kept under their thumb, so the Inespell March was
designated as a marquessate. The House would hold higher esteem in the peerage,
but would lose the autonomy that a Marcher Lordship enjoyed.

In the present day, the head of House Surrata not only holds the title of
Marquess, but also commands the Eastern Fleet as Lord High Admiral of the Realm.
