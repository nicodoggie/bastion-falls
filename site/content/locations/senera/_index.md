_Senera_ is a large island kingdom to the northwest of the
[Beteran Continent](@/locations/betera.md). Culturally, it is closely integrated
into the rest of the continent, due to its joint history, and its involvement
with a number of treaties and pacts with mainland states.

It stands as _Arbiter of the Seas_, officially for the
[Sarmatian Sea](@/locations/sarmatian-sea.md), but de facto for the entire
western leg of the
[Seneran-Apgarian-Posaran Trade Route](@/locations/seneran-apgarian-posaran-trade-route.md),
as well as for the vast and largely uncharted
[Great Gerim Sea](@/locations/great-gerim-sea.md) to the west of Senera and the
continent.

# History

## Pre-Kalassarian Era

### Early Hick Period (Before 110 AI)

Archaeological evidence suggests the indigenous Hick peoples developed
sophisticated maritime and forestry traditions long before Kalassarian contact.
Ancient stone arrangements and harbor structures indicate advanced understanding
of tides, astronomy, and navigation. The [Keelswood](@/locations/keelswood.md)
preserves evidence of their sophisticated forestry management techniques.

Ruins and artifacts from this period hint at conflicts with an unknown maritime
power, possibly explaining the Hicks' development of sophisticated coastal
defenses and navigation techniques. By the Late Hick period, their society had
divided between coastal iron-working communities and inland traditional
settlements.

### The Brams River Settlements

The [Brams River](@/locations/brams-river.md) held particular significance in
Hick culture. Its name derives from the ancient Hick phrase "Bram-aes"
("where-sea-comes"), reflecting its importance as both a trade route and sacred
waterway. Major settlements developed along its course, particularly at
strategic confluences and tidal observation points.

### Maritime Heritage

Early Seneran seafaring demonstrated remarkable sophistication in tide-reading
and astronomical navigation. The
[Gulf of Inespell](@/locations/gulf-of-inespell.md) was particularly important
to Hick maritime activities, though many of their practices were later
suppressed or adapted during the Kalassarian period.

## Kalassarian Period (110-466 AI) {#kalassarian-period}

During the
[Western Kalassarian Empire](@/organizations/western-kalassarian-empire.md)'s
height, Senera served as a crucial naval base in the empire's western maritime
frontier. As an island prefecture, it maintained both magically-powered
transportation networks (enabled by [Ritma](@/world-novelty/ritma.md)) and
conventional maritime routes.

The decline of Ritma from the 3rd century (~200s) onward reshaped this
relationship. While other imperial regions struggled with the loss of
magically-enhanced logistics and communication, Senera's established maritime
infrastructure allowed it to maintain relatively stable governance.

When [Kalassus](@/locations/kalassus.md) fell in 466, Senera was uniquely
positioned to transition smoothly into independence, only formally declaring
itself a kingdom after the fall of the
[Potol region](@/locations/tanduaria.md#kalassarian-potol) to the
[Tandoor](@/ethnicities/tandoor.md).

## Rise of the Maidenfeld Dynasty (Late 460s)

The [House of Maidenfeld](@/families/maidenfeld.md) emerged from the ranks of
Kalassarian naval administrators who had governed Senera's maritime prefecture.
Unlike the violent transitions in many post-Kalassarian territories, their
ascension represented a gradual shift from imperial bureaucracy to sovereign
authority.

### Administrative Continuity

The Maidenfelds maintained much of the existing Kalassarian administrative
structure, particularly:

- The naval command hierarchy
- Port administration systems
- Tax collection mechanisms
- Agricultural management
- Maritime trade regulations

Their legitimacy stemmed from their ability to preserve these institutions while
other regions collapsed into chaos. The nobility largely emerged from former
Kalassarian officials who had maintained control over key infrastructure and
trade routes during the transition.

### Maritime Aristocracy

Seneran aristocracy developed distinct characteristics from mainland nobles:

- Titles often tied to naval responsibilities
- Hereditary port administration rights
- Maritime trade privileges
- Coastal defense obligations
- Ship-building responsibilities

Their close relationship with [Sanery](@/locations/sanery.md), which maintained
similar administrative continuity, allowed both regions to preserve much of
their shared Kalassarian heritage while developing distinct maritime traditions.

### The Dragonheart Transition

The [House of Dragonheart](@/families/dragonheart.md)'s rise to power came
through a combination of naval prestige and marriage alliances with powerful
merchant families. Unlike the bureaucratic Maidenfelds, they represented a more
militant faction of the maritime aristocracy, advocating for aggressive
expansion of Seneran influence.

## Maritime Expansion and Continental Ambitions

The fragmentation of the [Hapgarian region](@/locations/hapgaria.md) created new
political dynamics. While [Baraon](@/locations/baraon.md) descended into
rebellion and famine in the 440s, Senera's maritime connections initially helped
it avoid the worst of the crisis. The Maidenfelds capitalized on this stability
to establish their spice trade networks.

The rise of the [House of Dragonheart](@/families/dragonheart.md) marked a shift
toward more aggressive continental ambitions. This culminated in failed military
campaigns during the 900s, where two successive Seneran kings attempted to
expand territories southward and eastward. These campaigns proved costly,
leading to widespread disillusionment among the nobility who had financed them.

## Modern Era (1225-Present)

The Fall of Bastion in 1225 marked the gradual return of Ritma to the world.
When the [Poasan-Apgarian Conflict](@/events/poasan-apgarian-conflict.md)
erupted as the first major conflict of this new magical era, Senera saw an
opportunity to pursue its long-dormant territorial ambitions.

Through the [Treaty of Turain](@/events/treaty-of-turain.md), Senera secured
significant control over maritime trade routes, establishing itself as a
dominant naval power in the region.

# Culture

## Peerage of the Realm

Since the Fall of Western Kalassar, there have only been two dynasties to rule
the entirety of Senera: the Maidenfelds and the Dragonhearts. While the
Maidenfelds did gradually develop the system of feudalism during their campaigns
to consolidate the realm under their dominion, it was the Dragonhearts who
formalized the peerage system.

The Peerage of the Realm was established following the War of Thyme and Fire,
along with sweeping reforms to the judicial and administrative systems of the
realm. It systematizes the existing feudal hierarchy, and codifies the rights
and responsibilities of the nobility.

These titles and lands are usually inherited by the bloodline of the holder, in
a manner that is consistent with the rules of primogeniture. In the modern era,
Senera had developed extensive jurisprudence to codify how titles within the
peerage are granted, inherited, and sometimes revoked.

### Royalty

Members of the ruling family of Senera hold the highest titles in the peerage.
The head of the Royal House is the King or Queen of Senera, depending on which
of the pair holds the direct line of succession. While by definition, the
Royalty is not a part of the peerage, specific members of the Royal House have
roles within the context of the peerage in certain circumstances, such as
resolving deadlocks in legislative matters.

### Duchies

Duchies are the most powerful of the peerage, and hold the largest holdings and
estates in the realm besides the Royalty. The term Duke came from Kalassarian
"Dux", which was a title granted to governors of provinces. In fact, the first
Maidenfeld King was once the Dux of Seneria before the Fall of Western Kalassar.

Dukes swear fealty to the King or Queen of Senera directly.

Presently, there are three duchies in the realm:

#### The Duchy of the Maltreks

#### The Duchy of Kethrek

#### The Duchy of the South (WIP)

### Marquessates

Marquessates are the second most powerful of the peerage. Their lands are
considered areas of military importance, and as such, the Marquesses are also
typically given top military command in the realm.

Marquesses, as with Dukes, swear fealty to the Crown directly.

#### The Marquessate of Inespell

#### The Marquessate of Rannek

### Earldoms and Thanedoms

Earldoms and Thanedoms are titles and lands typically granted by a Duke or a
Marquess. They are the third most powerful of the peerage. While the Crown has
final say over the confirmation of these titles, Earls and Thanes are expected
to swear fealty to the Duke or Marquess who granted them their title.

#### Earldoms of Inespell

#### Earldoms of Rannek

#### Thanedoms of the Maltreks

#### Earldoms of the South

### Viscounties

Viscounties are the second lowest rank within the peerage. They are typically granted
by Earls or Thanes, but are also sometimes granted by Dukes or Marquesses to
cadet branches of their houses. Viscounties are usually granted along with large
contiguous agricultural estates in order to ease tax collection.

#### Viscounties of Inespell

#### Viscounties of Rannek

1. Maidenfeld

#### Viscounties of the South

### Baronies

Baronies are the lowest rank within the peerage. They are typically granted to
land holders of key townships, ports and cities where trade and commerce is
paramount, but are not large enough to be considered a county.

## Landed Gentry

### Baronetcies

Baronetcies are considered by most as the lowest noble rank, however they are
outside the peerage system. They are sometimes granted lands that are equal to,
or even larger that some Baronies, but they are not granted the privileges of
those within the peerage, such as the right to a vote in legislative matters.

The distinction between granting a title of Baron or Baronet is a political one,
in which their lord would want to bestow a title, while minimizing political
implications.

### Knights

In the early days of the realm, knighthoods were granted to families within the
equestrian class who did not have the political clout to be granted a higher
title to. Knights are given estates within their liege lord's domain along with
a stipend to support their knightly duties.

## Religion

### Orthodox Divine Masochism

The state religion since mid-2nd century AI, Orthodox Divine Masochism pervades
all aspects of Seneran society. The conversion from Kalassarian paganism was
systematic and complete, with traditional practices strictly outlawed.

#### Religious Administration

- Central ecclesiastical authority
- Regional church courts
- Parish system
- Monastic orders
- Theological schools

#### Public Worship

- Mandatory attendance
- Regular ceremonies
- Festival calendar
- Public penances
- Communal rituals

# Feudal Hierarchy

After the Maidenfelds seized power, they swiftly established a Patrilineal
Primogeniture as a means of ensuring their hold on power. But in 675 AI, the
prolific royal house became mired in a succession crisis that led to a violent
civil war. The Succession War forced the House of Maidenfeld to implement an
Elective Monarchy, with certain titles within the nobility holding the privilege
of _electorship_. These electors are collectively called the _Noble Electorate_.

After the War of Thyme and Fire, the Dragonhearts were able to consolidate their
power and had reformed the system of feudal hierarchy. Their reforms changed how
the ruling monarch was chosen, they streamlined the number of titles to have
more rigidly defined ranks within a peerage, then codified the rules and
responsibilities each rank enjoyed.

The Noble Electorate lost the right to elect the monarch, but retained the right
to deliberate the passage of new taxes and laws.

## Primogeniture

The Dragonhearts established an Equal Primogeniture where male and female
members of the royal line had equal opportunity to inherit the throne. They
established that the King and Queen would share joint authority over the realm,
but only the blood members of the ruling family may inherit the throne.

For example, if the current monarchs do not have children, and the Queen was the
daughter of the provious monarch, only her siblings could inherit. The King's
line could only inherit if there were no blood relatives of any degree of
consanguinity are left from the Queen's line.

## Monarchy

### King and Queen of Senera

<aside class="sidebar">
- Current Holder: [House Dragonheart](@/locations/senera/noble-houses.md#house-dragonheart)
- Seat: Thrantorbury
- King: Threngral Dragonheart
- Queen: Aelith Maidenfeld-Dragonheart
</aside>

The King and Queen, by law, hold the highest authority in the realm. They are
co-equal rulers and share joint authority over the realm. However, only the
member of the ruling family may inherit the throne according to the rules of
primogeniture.

The King and Queen may decide among themselves which portions of authority they
shall exercise, but there are no legal limits to the authority of either
monarch.

Their roles, duties, and privileges are as follows:

- Ultimate authority over the lands and titles of the realm
- Power to veto legislation passed by the Noble Electorate
- Power to declare martial law, which in itself allows:
  - Imposition of emergency taxes
  - Declaration of emergency legislation
  - Conscription of military forces
  - Requisitioning of supplies and resources
  - Suspension of certain rights and privileges
- Authority to declare war
- Authority to grant and/or confirm noble entitlements
