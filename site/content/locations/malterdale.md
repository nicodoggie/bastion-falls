_Malterdale_ is a region in the Western Lowlands of Senera, and is the seat of
the Viscount of Malterdale. It encompasses the port town of
[Port Sera-by-Malterdale](@/locations/port-sera-by-malterdale.md),
[Fort Malterdale](@/locations/fort-malterdale.md) and the surrounding
countryside. It is also where the visible portion of the
[Malter River](@/locations/malter-river.md) terminates at
[Malterford](@/locations/malterford.md).

# History

The Malterdale lands were established as an Earldom in the 650s AI as a direct
vassal of the [Maidenfeld](@/families/maidenfeld.md) crown. The family had been
pivotal in the transport of the materials needed for the massive flood control
and land reclamation projects in the Rannek Delta.

However, the aftermath of the
[War of Thyme and Fire](@/events/war-of-thyme-and-fire.md), the new ruling house
of the Seneran throne, had dissolved the noble status of all of the allies of
the Maidenfelds, in order to restructure the peerage in a way that was more
favorable to the new regime. To at least recognize the importance of the region,
the Dragonhearts granted the title of Viscount to the family, under the
vassalage of the Earl of the Lowlands.

But in 1051 AI, the Earldom along with a cadet branch of the Maidenfeld family,
attempted to overthrow the Dragonheart regime. The rebellion was quickly quelled
by the Duke of Rannek, supported by the Malterdales and the main branch of the
Maidenfeld family, who wanted to wash their hands of the affair. Instead of
establishing a new earldom, the crown had decided to simply dissolve the
existing earldom, and reorganized the region to be a part of the Marquessate of
Rannek. The Marquess of Rannek then awarded additional lands to expand the
Viscounties of the Malterdales and the Maidenfelds.

# Administration

The current Viscount of Malterdale is very hands on, and administers his lands
quite actively. Fort Malterdale, the seat of the Viscount, is directly
administered by the Viscount himself. Each of the major townships, such as Port
Sera and Malterford are administered by duly selected seneschal, who report
directly to the Viscount.

Each major township has a council of advisors, selected from the local nobility
and the various merchant and trade guilds of the region.

The guards in the major townships are part of the
[Seneran Royal Navy](@/organizations/seneran-royal-navy.md), under the command
of the Rear Admiral of the Western Fleet, a title held by the Marquess of
Rannek.

# Economy

Malterdale's economy is based on trade, providing a connection between the
Malter River trade with access to the sea. A section of the
[Aitarel River](@/locations/aitarel-river.md) also passes through the region,
providing access to the interior, and a connection to the
[Brams River](@/locations/brams-river.md) trade.

## Fort Malterdale

Fort Malterdale is the seat of the Viscount of Malterdale, and the center of
administration of the entirety of Malterdale. The fortress itself is of a unique
architectural style and engineering design that seems to predate the Kalassarian
conquest, and is quite different from the other fortifications of the era.

### Exterior

The main structure is built from hard basalt blocks and held together with a
hardy lime mortar. The interior walls are adorned with finely carved stonework
and woodcarvings, with cornices and columns decorated with a detailed filigree
unseen in other structures of the era. The roof structure consists of heavy
timber trusses, supporting a layered construction of wooden planks, clay tiles,
and a waterproof lime-based plaster. Its floors are made of a finely polished
marble.

The fort's first layer of walls are similarly built from basalt and lime mortar,
but are now covered in a thick layer of moss and lichens. Additions of iron
links surround the outside face of the walls, which are believed to have been a
late addition, but still predates known history.

A second layer of walls encircles a residential area and the inner bailey. This
layer seems to have been originally constructed with similar materials as the
inner layer, but it seems to have been more recently repaired and reinforced
with stone blocks and mortar. Ramparts above the walls, built by the same
unknown craftsmen who had constructed the fortress, are well-placed to
accommodate spellcasters in the event of a siege.

There used to be a third layer of walls, that included battlements equipped with
ballistae and accommodations for archers atop the edge of an escarpment
overlooking the coastline where Port Sera is now located. The walls themselves
were destroyed during the War of Thyme and Fire, but some battlements and
turrets remained. One such battlement was converted into the
[Battlement Inn](@/locations/battlement-inn.md) by an enterprising widow.

### Interior

The interior of the fortress are a series of large, open chambers arranged in a
single story, sprawling layout. The central chamber is the largest, and is used
for the Viscount's audience chamber. Auxiliary chambers are used as
administration offices, and the Archives, which stores not only the Malterdales'
historical records, but also a copy of rare and valuable books from the region.
They are known to have copies of some undeciphered pre-Kalassarian texts, and
have been known to make copies of rare tomes from elsewhere in the region.
