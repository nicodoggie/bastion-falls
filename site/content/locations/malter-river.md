# Geography

## Source

The Malter River originates from the Western Maltreks' extensive karst aquifer
system. After its tributaries combine into the main channel, the river flows
visibly for only a few miles across the highland valley floor. At the valley's
end, it encounters massive limestone formations where it disappears underground,
continuing its journey through vast cave systems. This underground river network
eventually feeds into the extensive Rannek karst system, creating one of Senera's
largest subterranean watersheds.

## Course

The river's visible course, though brief, is characterized by deep, clear pools
and swift rapids. Its disappearance point, locally known as the Great Swallow,
marks where the river plunges into a massive cave mouth, creating a spectacular
waterfall during high flow seasons.
