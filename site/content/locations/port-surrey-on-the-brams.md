**Port Surrey-on-the-Brams** is a major port city in
[Senera](@/locations/senera.md), situated on a strategic island where the
[Brams River](@/locations/brams-river.md) splits before entering the
[Gulf of Inespell](@/locations/gulf-of-inespell.md). It serves as the primary
base for the [Seneran Navy](@/organizations/seneran-military.md#navy) and houses
the notorious Admiralty Prison.

## History

### Early Settlement

The earliest recorded settlements on Surrey-on-the-Brams were concentrated
around what is now the Narrows district. These early maritime communities took
advantage of the natural harbors and strategic position to control river
traffic, developing the first pilot services for navigating the challenging
channels. The original Wardcross bridges, though primitive by modern standards,
established the island's importance as a crossing point for land- based trade.

### Kalassarian Period

The Kalassarian Empire transformed Surrey-on-the-Brams from a strategic crossing
point into a major imperial port. While they maintained and enhanced the
existing Wardcross bridges, their most ambitious project was the construction of
the Northcross Bridge, connecting the northern shore directly to the mainland.
This massive structure, incorporating both magical and physical engineering,
demonstrated the empire's technical prowess and cemented the port's dominance
over river traffic.

The Kalassarians imposed their characteristic order on the growing city,
establishing the rigid grid system still visible in the eastern districts. Their
engineers reshaped the eastern shoreline, constructing the seawalls and port
facilities that would serve as the foundation for modern shipyards. The Crow's
Nest plateau was fortified, and its natural defenses were enhanced through a
combination of magical and conventional engineering.

### Silent Ages (435-1225 AI)

The collapse of magical infrastructure during the Silent Ages forced significant
adaptations throughout the city. The loss of magical lifting mechanisms in the
bridges led to the development of innovative mechanical solutions, many of which
continue to function today. The Admiralty's Helm, previously served by magical
transport systems, required new supply routes and mechanical lifts, leading to
the expansion of prison labor programs for their operation and maintenance.

### Modern Era

Today's Port Surrey reflects both its imperial past and the practical
adaptations of the Silent Ages. The city has evolved into Senera's primary naval
base while maintaining its crucial role in river commerce. Recent efforts to
recover and understand Kalassarian magical engineering have led to some
restoration of ancient systems, though most of the city still relies on the
robust mechanical solutions developed during the Silent Ages.


## Mainland Connections

Port Surrey maintains three major bridge connections to mainland Senera. These
massive structures date back to the Kalassarian Empire, though their current
operation relies on engineering solutions developed during the Silent Ages.

Recent post-Bastion scholarship has uncovered evidence that the bridges'
original lifting mechanisms relied on magical engineering. Traces of
_[Ritma](@/notes/theorycrafting/ritma-and-planar-theory.md)_ enchantments can
still be found in the ancient counterweight chambers, suggesting the massive
drawbridge sections were once raised and lowered through magical means. When
these systems failed during the Silent Ages (435-1225 AI), Seneran engineers
developed an intricate system of mechanical counterweights and pulleys to
replace the lost magical functionality.

### Northcross Bridge

The Northcross Bridge spans the Northern Channel, connecting Port Surrey to the
northern bank of the Brams River. Its massive stone piers, a testament to
Kalassarian architecture, rise from the deepest part of the channel. The central
span's original magical lifting mechanism was replaced during the Silent Ages
with an elaborate counterweight system that, while effective, requires
significantly more maintenance than its magical predecessor. When raised, the
bridge provides a clearance of sixty feet, while its stone towers rise nearly a
hundred feet above the water.

### Wardcross North Bridge

Connecting Port Surrey to Wardcross Isle, the North Bridge retains much of its
original Kalassarian stonework, though its wooden spans have been replaced
countless times. Archaeological studies have revealed traces of magical
resonance in the twin towers at each end, suggesting they once housed more
sophisticated control mechanisms than the current mechanical systems. The
bridge's defensive features remain impressive: the wooden spans can still be
quickly dismantled in times of crisis, effectively isolating the island from
land approach.

### Wardcross South Bridge

The South Bridge, spanning from Wardcross Isle to the southern mainland,
features Kalassarian engineering at its finest. Its graceful stone arches have
survived centuries, though the central drawbridge mechanism has been extensively
modified. The original magical lifting system, traces of which were recently
discovered in the gatehouse foundations, was replaced with a complex arrangement
of counterweights during the Silent Ages.

Modern engineers maintain these bridges using a combination of traditional
mechanical systems developed during the Silent Ages and, increasingly, restored
magical techniques recovered through post-Bastion research. Prison labor crews
handle the physical maintenance under the supervision of skilled engineers,
while magical scholars study the remaining traces of Kalassarian enchantments,
hoping to better understand—and perhaps one day restore—the original mechanisms.

## Districts

The city of Port Surrey-on-the-Brams spans the entirety of Surrey-on-the-Brams
island, its five districts reflecting both its organic growth from early
maritime settlements and the planned development imposed by Kalassarian
colonization. This contrast is most visible in the street layouts: the older
western districts preserve their irregular, terrain-following patterns, while
the eastern districts display rigid Kalassarian grid planning.

### The Admiralty's Helm

Peering downfrom the Crow's Nest plateau, [The Admiralty's Helm]
(@/locations/admiraltys-helm.md) serves as the military and administrative
heart of Port Surrey, its position offering commanding views over both river
channels and the gulf beyond.
