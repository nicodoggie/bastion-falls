**Port Surrey-on-the-Brams** is a major port city in the
[Seneran](@/locations/senera.md) island of
[Surrey-on-the-Brams](@/locations/surrey-on-the-brams.md). It is situated where
the [Great Surrey Reach](@/locations/great-surrey-reach.md) meets the
[Gulf of Inespell](@/locations/gulf-of-inespell.md). The city operates under
oversight from [The Admiralty's Helm](@/locations/admiraltys-helm.md), which
rises on the plateau above, housing the command center of the
[Royal Seneran Navy](@/organizations/seneran-military.md#navy).

## History

### Kalassarian Foundation

The city began as the Kalassarian settlement of "Surrata" ("safe
harbor/landing"), strategically positioned where the Great Surrey Reach meets
the Gulf of Inespell. Imperial planners selected this previously undeveloped
site for its natural deep-water harbor and the defensive advantages offered by
the Crow's Nest plateau.

### Imperial Development (Pre-435 AI)

The Kalassarian Empire transformed Surrata into a major imperial port through
systematic expansion and engineering. Their most ambitious project was the
Northcross Bridge, connecting the northern shore directly to the mainland. This
massive structure demonstrated their mastery of both magical and physical
engineering, establishing the port's dominance over river traffic.

The empire imposed its characteristic order on the growing city, implementing
the rigid grid system still visible in the eastern districts. Their engineers
reshaped the eastern shoreline, constructing seawalls and port facilities that
would serve as the foundation for modern shipyards. The Crow's Nest plateau was
fortified, its natural defenses enhanced through a combination of magical and
conventional engineering.

### Silent Ages (435-1225 AI)

The collapse of magical infrastructure during the Silent Ages forced significant
adaptations throughout the city. The loss of magical lifting mechanisms in the
bridges led to innovative mechanical solutions, many still functioning today.
The Admiralty's Helm, previously served by magical transport systems, required
new supply routes and mechanical lifts, leading to the expansion of prison labor
programs for their operation and maintenance.

### Modern Era (1225 AI-Present)

Today's Port Surrey reflects both its imperial heritage and Silent Age
adaptations. While recent scholarship has recovered some understanding of
Kalassarian magical engineering, most of the city still relies on the robust
mechanical solutions developed during the Silent Ages. The city has evolved into
Senera's primary naval base while maintaining its crucial role in river
commerce, with the Admiralty carefully balancing military priorities with
commercial needs.

## Major Thoroughfares

### Northcross Bridge

The Northcross Bridge spans the Great Surrey Reach, connecting Port Surrey to
the northern bank. Its massive stone piers, a testament to Kalassarian
architecture, rise from the deepest part of the channel. The central span's
original magical lifting mechanism was replaced during the Silent Ages with an
elaborate counterweight system. When raised, the bridge provides a clearance of
sixty feet, while its stone towers rise nearly a hundred feet above the water.

Recent post-Bastion scholarship has uncovered evidence that the bridge's
original lifting mechanisms relied on magical engineering. Traces of
_[Ritma](@/world-novelty/ritma.md)_ enchantments can still be found in the
ancient counterweight chambers, suggesting the massive drawbridge sections were
once raised and lowered through magical means.

### Admiralty Way

Running along the northern shore from the Northcross Bridge to the Admiralty
Dockyards, Admiralty Way serves as the primary artery for naval logistics and
commerce. This broad thoroughfare features:

- Deep-water berths with ancient Kalassarian stone wharves
- Modern loading facilities
- Military checkpoints
- Customs inspection stations
- Merchant warehouses
- Naval administrative buildings

The road's elevation provides commanding views of the Great Surrey Reach while
allowing for efficient movement of goods between the dockyards and the bridge.
Multiple access points to the water allow for rapid naval response when needed.

## Districts

The city of Port Surrey-on-the-Brams comprises three distinct districts, each
reflecting the city's evolution from a planned Kalassarian port to a modern
maritime center. The eastern districts preserve the rigid Kalassarian grid

## Industries

### Timber Trade and Distribution

While the primary lumber mills operate along Keelswood Way under Admiralty
oversight, Port Surrey serves as the commercial hub for timber distribution. The
city's role focuses on:

- Commercial lumber yards and warehouses
- Timber merchants and brokers
- Quality inspection facilities
- Export processing
- Specialty wood products
- Ship timber stockpiles

The Shipwright's Guild maintains significant influence over the timber trade,
operating inspection facilities and managing distribution to various shipyards.
Their headquarters in the Port Surrey District serves as the primary exchange
for timber contracts and negotiations.

Shipwright guilds, representing civilian and commercial interests, are in
constant negotiation with the Admiralty for access to timber. These guilds must
navigate complex agreements regarding pricing, allocation, and usage rights,
often competing with each other for limited resources. As a result, there are
times when importing wood from other regions becomes a more economical option
for shipwrights, especially when local prices rise or specific types of wood are
unavailable.

Despite the Navy's dominance, a few independent yards manage to operate on the
periphery, sourcing timber from other regions or specializing in unique wood
products. These yards provide some diversity in the market, catering to specific
needs that the larger operations might overlook.

The timber trade is further regulated by a powerful guild, which oversees fair
practices and mediates between the yards, the Navy, and the city government.
This ensures sustainable use of the Keelswood and attempts to balance the
competing interests of military and civilian needs.

Commercial yards must navigate complex agreements with both the Admiralty and
the Guild regarding pricing and allocation. During periods of high naval demand
or limited local supply, merchants often supplement their inventory with
imported timber, particularly for specialized woods not available from the
Keelswood.

### Shipbuilding Industry

Shipbuilding represents Port Surrey's most vital industry, combining Kalassarian
engineering heritage with modern Seneran naval expertise. The industry is
divided between military and commercial production, though with significant
overlap in standards and workforce.

#### Admiralty Dockyards

The naval shipbuilding complex contains:

- **First Basin**: Primary capital ship construction facility, featuring the
  ancient Kalassarian stone dock
- **Second Basin**: Frigate construction and general refitting, with four modern
  graving docks
- **Third Basin**: Specialized construction and prototype testing
- **Fourth Basin**: Major repair facility, incorporating preserved Kalassarian
  flood control systems

#### Commercial Facilities

The Port Surrey District hosts several major commercial yards:

- **Honest Toil Yards**: Large merchant vessel construction, operating three
  modern building slips
- **Tidebinder's Basin**: Traditional wooden shipbuilding, maintaining
  centuries-old techniques
- **Riverman's Rest**: Specialized in river craft and coastal vessels, with
  extensive repair facilities

The Shipwright's Guild maintains strict control over construction standards and
apprenticeship training. All yards must maintain capability for naval
production, with commercial facilities regularly fulfilling Admiralty contracts
for support vessels and merchant conversions.

The concentration of shipbuilding expertise in Port Surrey ensures consistent
quality while fostering innovation through controlled competition between yards.
The industry's organization reflects both Kalassarian administrative heritage
and Seneran maritime traditions, with ancient engineering principles adapted to
modern naval requirements.

### Trade and Commerce

Port Surrey's commercial dominance stems from its privileged position under the
Treaty of Turain, which established Senera as Arbiter of the Seas. The port
serves as a crucial nexus for several major trade routes:

### Western Trade Routes

- Apgarian trade fleets (under treaty regulations)
- Mehicanian merchant convoys
- Ahurian long-distance traders
- Independent merchant vessels

### Northeastern Routes

Through the demilitarized Raibon Island, Port Surrey maintains vital trade links
with northeastern Betera:

- Carlmark merchant fleets
- Iutland trading vessels
- Fayneland commercial shipping

### Posaran Sea Basin Trade

The Mirian Trading Company's near-monopoly on Posaran Sea trade makes Port
Surrey a crucial transshipment point for goods from:

- Southern Poasan luxury goods
- Mehicanian textiles and crafts
- Kolhan spices and aromatics
- Northern Ahurian precious metals and gemstones
- Nuran agricultural products and wine
- Calamutian books and other scholarly works
- Freehold city-state exports

Their liaison office in Port Rainoso coordinates complex trading networks, often
combining cargoes from multiple Posaran sources for efficient distribution to
northern markets.

### Northern Routes

- Direct trade with Port Imago (Poasah)
- Northern Sea connections
- Coastal trading vessels

### Trade Administration

The port's commercial operations are overseen by three key entities:

- Treaty of Turain Organization liaison office
- Admiralty Commerce Bureau
- Port Surrey Merchant's Council

All foreign vessels must register with both the Admiralty and the Merchant's
Council, with special provisions for Poasan-flagged ships under alliance
agreements. The port maintains dedicated facilities for treaty-compliant
Apgarian merchant fleets, reflecting the careful balance between commercial
access and naval security.

### Other Industries

[Include any other significant industries, such as fishing, manufacturing,
or services, that contribute to the city's economy.]

## Military Significance

Port Surrey-on-the-Brams serves as Senera's primary naval base and maritime
control center. Its military facilities are distributed across several key
locations, each serving distinct but interconnected roles in maintaining
Senera's naval supremacy.

### Command and Control

From their commanding position atop the Crow's Nest plateau, the Admiralty's
Helm houses the nerve center of Seneran naval power. The Naval High Command
operates from this fortress-like complex, where strategic planning facilities
and intelligence operations maintain constant vigilance over Senera's maritime
interests. A sophisticated communications center ensures reliable contact with
vessels throughout Seneran waters, while senior staff reside in protected
quarters within the complex. The facility also incorporates the notorious Splits
prison, the carefully managed the Keelswood reserve, and the Liaison Office of
the Treaty of Turain Organization.

### Defensive Infrastructure

Port Surrey's defensive network extends well beyond its military facilities.
Artillery batteries guard both channels, while anti-ship emplacements provide
overlapping fields of fire. A network of coastal watch stations maintains
constant surveillance of approaching vessels. Quick-response squadrons maintain
constant readiness, able to challenge any threat to the port's security.

### Maritime Control

As enforcer of the [Treaty of Turain](@/events/treaty-of-turain.md), Port Surrey
maintains strict control over maritime traffic through three critical waterways:
the Gulf of Inespell, Greater Surrey Reach, and the Brams River. This
responsibility requires constant vigilance and a sophisticated network of
enforcement capabilities.

In the Gulf of Inespell, patrol squadrons monitor approaching vessels, ensuring
compliance with treaty provisions long before they reach Seneran waters. These
deep-water patrols serve as the first line of maritime defense, intercepting
suspicious vessels and escorting important convoys.

Greater Surrey Reach serves as a transitional zone where all vessels must submit
to inspection before proceeding upriver or into port. Here, customs officers
conduct thorough examinations while intelligence agents monitor for signs of
smuggling or treaty violations. The narrow confines of the Reach allow for
comprehensive control over maritime traffic, with multiple inspection anchorages
keeping commerce flowing smoothly despite rigorous security measures.

Control over the Brams River focuses on maintaining safe passage while
preventing unauthorized access to Senera's interior waterways. Licensed pilot
services, operating under naval oversight, guide vessels through the challenging
channels. Strategic checkpoints along the river ensure continued compliance with
maritime regulations, while rapid-response vessels stand ready to address any
emergencies or security threats.

This layered system of maritime control extends Port Surrey's influence far
beyond its immediate vicinity, establishing it as the primary arbiter of
maritime law in the region. The port's authority is reinforced by a
comprehensive intelligence network, with informants and observers in every major
port monitoring shipping patterns and reporting suspicious activities.

### Naval-Commercial Integration

The relationship between naval and commercial shipbuilding in Port Surrey
reflects both practical necessity and strategic planning. While the Admiralty
Dockyards handle most naval construction, several arrangements exist for broader
integration:

#### Emergency Production

During wartime or urgent naval expansion, commercial yards operate under
Admiralty commission to supplement military production:

- Northcross Maritime Works converts its large slips for frigate construction
- Surrey Guild Yards builds specialized patrol craft
- River Works focuses on support vessels and tender construction

#### Vessel Conversion Program

The Admiralty maintains a structured program for converting naval vessels to
commercial use:

- Decommissioned vessels undergo security stripping at the Fourth Basin
- Munitions and specialized equipment removal follows strict protocols
- Modified ships receive civilian certification before sale
- Preference given to Seneran merchants who maintain naval auxiliary status

#### Shared Resources

Both sectors benefit from:

- Common training programs through the Shipwright's Guild
- Standardized quality control procedures
- Shared timber allocation system
- Combined apprenticeship programs
- Technical knowledge exchange

This integration ensures Port Surrey maintains surge capacity for naval
production while supporting a robust commercial shipbuilding industry.
