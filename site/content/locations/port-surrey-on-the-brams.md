**Port Surrey-on-the-Brams** is a major port city in
[Senera](@/locations/senera.md), situated on a strategic island where the
[Brams River](@/locations/brams-river.md) splits before entering the
[Gulf of Inespell](@/locations/gulf-of-inespell.md). It serves as the primary
base for the [Seneran Navy](@/organizations/seneran-military.md#navy) and houses
the notorious Admiralty Prison.

## History

### Early Settlement

The earliest recorded settlements on Surrey-on-the-Brams were concentrated
around what is now the Narrows district. These early maritime communities took
advantage of the natural harbors and strategic position to control river
traffic, developing the first pilot services for navigating the challenging
channels. The original Wardcross bridges, though primitive by modern standards,
established the island's importance as a crossing point for land- based trade.

### Kalassarian Period

The Kalassarian Empire transformed Surrey-on-the-Brams from a strategic crossing
point into a major imperial port. While they maintained and enhanced the
existing Wardcross bridges, their most ambitious project was the construction of
the Northcross Bridge, connecting the northern shore directly to the mainland.
This massive structure, incorporating both magical and physical engineering,
demonstrated the empire's technical prowess and cemented the port's dominance
over river traffic.

The Kalassarians imposed their characteristic order on the growing city,
establishing the rigid grid system still visible in the eastern districts. Their
engineers reshaped the eastern shoreline, constructing the seawalls and port
facilities that would serve as the foundation for modern shipyards. The Crow's
Nest plateau was fortified, and its natural defenses were enhanced through a
combination of magical and conventional engineering.

### Silent Ages (435-1225 AI)

The collapse of magical infrastructure during the Silent Ages forced significant
adaptations throughout the city. The loss of magical lifting mechanisms in the
bridges led to the development of innovative mechanical solutions, many of which
continue to function today. The Admiralty's Helm, previously served by magical
transport systems, required new supply routes and mechanical lifts, leading to
the expansion of prison labor programs for their operation and maintenance.

### Modern Era

Today's Port Surrey reflects both its imperial past and the practical
adaptations of the Silent Ages. The city has evolved into Senera's primary naval
base while maintaining its crucial role in river commerce. Recent efforts to
recover and understand Kalassarian magical engineering have led to some
restoration of ancient systems, though most of the city still relies on the
robust mechanical solutions developed during the Silent Ages.

## Mainland Connections

Port Surrey maintains three major bridge connections to mainland Senera. These
massive structures date back to the Kalassarian Empire, though their current
operation relies on engineering solutions developed during the Silent Ages.

Recent post-Bastion scholarship has uncovered evidence that the bridges'
original lifting mechanisms relied on magical engineering. Traces of
_[Ritma](@/notes/theorycrafting/ritma-and-planar-theory.md)_ enchantments can
still be found in the ancient counterweight chambers, suggesting the massive
drawbridge sections were once raised and lowered through magical means. When
these systems failed during the Silent Ages (435-1225 AI), Seneran engineers
developed an intricate system of mechanical counterweights and pulleys to
replace the lost magical functionality.

### Northcross Bridge

The Northcross Bridge spans the Northern Channel, connecting Port Surrey to the
northern bank of the Brams River. Its massive stone piers, a testament to
Kalassarian architecture, rise from the deepest part of the channel. The central
span's original magical lifting mechanism was replaced during the Silent Ages
with an elaborate counterweight system that, while effective, requires
significantly more maintenance than its magical predecessor. When raised, the
bridge provides a clearance of sixty feet, while its stone towers rise nearly a
hundred feet above the water.

### Wardcross North Bridge

Connecting Port Surrey to Wardcross Isle, the North Bridge retains much of its
original Kalassarian stonework, though its wooden spans have been replaced
countless times. Archaeological studies have revealed traces of magical
resonance in the twin towers at each end, suggesting they once housed more
sophisticated control mechanisms than the current mechanical systems. The
bridge's defensive features remain impressive: the wooden spans can still be
quickly dismantled in times of crisis, effectively isolating the island from
land approach.

### Wardcross South Bridge

The South Bridge, spanning from Wardcross Isle to the southern mainland,
features Kalassarian engineering at its finest. Its graceful stone arches have
survived centuries, though the central drawbridge mechanism has been extensively
modified. The original magical lifting system, traces of which were recently
discovered in the gatehouse foundations, was replaced with a complex arrangement
of counterweights during the Silent Ages.

Modern engineers maintain these bridges using a combination of traditional
mechanical systems developed during the Silent Ages and, increasingly, restored
magical techniques recovered through post-Bastion research. Prison labor crews
handle the physical maintenance under the supervision of skilled engineers,
while magical scholars study the remaining traces of Kalassarian enchantments,
hoping to better understand—and perhaps one day restore—the original mechanisms.

## Districts

The city of Port Surrey-on-the-Brams spans the entirety of Surrey-on-the-Brams
island, its five districts reflecting both its organic growth from early
maritime settlements and the planned development imposed by Kalassarian
colonization. This contrast is most visible in the street layouts: the older
western districts preserve their irregular, terrain-following patterns, while
the eastern districts display rigid Kalassarian grid planning.

## Industries

Port Surrey-on-the-Brams is a bustling hub of economic activity, with several
key industries driving its growth and prosperity. These industries are closely
tied to the city's strategic location and its role as a major port and naval
base.

### Timber Industry

The timber industry in Port Surrey is tightly controlled by the Royal Navy,
which acts as the primary gatekeeper to the valuable resources of the Keelswood.
This control ensures that the construction and maintenance of naval vessels are
prioritized, reflecting the strategic importance of the port as Senera's primary
naval base.

The central lumber mill, operated under Admiralty oversight, processes timber
from the Keelswood and allocates it according to naval priorities. This
centralized control allows the Navy to maintain a steady supply of high-quality
wood for shipbuilding and other military needs.

Shipwright guilds, representing civilian and commercial interests, are in
constant negotiation with the Admiralty for access to timber. These guilds must
navigate complex agreements regarding pricing, allocation, and usage rights,
often competing with each other for limited resources. As a result, there are
times when importing wood from other regions becomes a more economical option
for shipwrights, especially when local prices rise or specific types of wood are
unavailable.

Despite the Navy's dominance, a few independent yards manage to operate on the
periphery, sourcing timber from other regions or specializing in unique wood
products. These yards provide some diversity in the market, catering to specific
needs that the larger operations might overlook.

The timber trade is further regulated by a powerful guild, which oversees fair
practices and mediates between the yards, the Navy, and the city government.
This ensures sustainable use of the Keelswood and attempts to balance the
competing interests of military and civilian needs.

## Military Significance

Port Surrey-on-the-Brams serves as Senera's primary naval base and maritime
control center. Its military facilities are distributed across several key
locations, each serving distinct but interconnected roles in maintaining
Senera's naval supremacy.

### Command and Control

From their commanding position atop the Crow's Nest plateau, the Admiralty's
Helm houses the nerve center of Seneran naval power. The Naval High Command
operates from this fortress-like complex, where strategic planning facilities
and intelligence operations maintain constant vigilance over Senera's maritime
interests. A sophisticated communications center ensures reliable contact with
vessels throughout Seneran waters, while senior staff reside in protected
quarters within the complex. The facility also incorporates the notorious Splits
prison and the carefully managed the Keelswood reserve.

### Defensive Infrastructure

Port Surrey's defensive network extends well beyond its military facilities.
Artillery batteries guard both channels, while anti-ship emplacements provide
overlapping fields of fire. The mysterious Surrey's Ear serves as a natural
observation post, complementing a network of coastal watch stations. Quick-
response squadrons maintain constant readiness, able to challenge any threat to
the port's security.

### Maritime Control

As enforcer of the [Treaty of Turain](@/events/treaty-of-turain.md), Port Surrey
maintains strict control over maritime traffic through three critical waterways:
the Gulf of Inespell, Greater Surrey Reach, and the Brams River. This
responsibility requires constant vigilance and a sophisticated network of
enforcement capabilities.

In the Gulf of Inespell, patrol squadrons monitor approaching vessels, ensuring
compliance with treaty provisions long before they reach Seneran waters. These
deep-water patrols serve as the first line of maritime defense, intercepting
suspicious vessels and escorting important convoys.

Greater Surrey Reach serves as a transitional zone where all vessels must submit
to inspection before proceeding upriver or into port. Here, customs officers
conduct thorough examinations while intelligence agents monitor for signs of
smuggling or treaty violations. The narrow confines of the Reach allow for
comprehensive control over maritime traffic, with multiple inspection anchorages
keeping commerce flowing smoothly despite rigorous security measures.

Control over the Brams River focuses on maintaining safe passage while
preventing unauthorized access to Senera's interior waterways. Licensed pilot
services, operating under naval oversight, guide vessels through the challenging
channels. Strategic checkpoints along the river ensure continued compliance with
maritime regulations, while rapid-response vessels stand ready to address any
emergencies or security threats.

This layered system of maritime control extends Port Surrey's influence far
beyond its immediate vicinity, establishing it as the primary arbiter of
maritime law in the region. The port's authority is reinforced by a
comprehensive intelligence network, with informants and observers in every major
port monitoring shipping patterns and reporting suspicious activities.
