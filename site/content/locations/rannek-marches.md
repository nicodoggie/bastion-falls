_The Rannek Marches_ are a rich agricultural region in the western-most end of
Senera. It is famous for the massive flood control systems of weirs and dams
that have been built over the centuries to keep tidal and seasonal flooding at
bay. The reclaimed land is some of the most fertile in the entire island. It
used to be the administrative center of the Kingdom of Senera after the collapse
of the Kalassarian Empire, when the [Maidenfelds](@/families/maidenfeld.md)
held the Crown. The region has been reorganized as the Rannek Marches by the
[Dragonheart Dynasty](@/families/dragonheart.md) after the
[War of Thyme and Fire](@/events/war-of-thyme-and-fire.md).
