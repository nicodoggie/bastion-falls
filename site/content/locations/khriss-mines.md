_The Khriss Mines_ refer to both the mines, and the settlement forme to house
the miners that work them. Until recently, the area was relatively heavily
settled due to the success of the mining operations in the area. However, an
unknown catastrophe had killed all of its inhabitants.

The mines and the settlement are supposed to be completely abandoned, however
exploration by [Goldilocks Westfall](@/characters/goldilocks-westfall.md) and
her team discovered recent activity in the area by members of the
[Reformed Church of the Divine Masochist](@/organizations/reformed-church-of-the-divine-masochist.md).

# Locations

Their logs list the following locations within the settlement:

## Roc Nest

About 300 ft above the settlement was a nest of gargantuan black birds. These
birds didn't seem to be hostile, despite their menacing size and appearance, but
seemed to have been guarding their hatchlings.

Goldie and her group had intentionally provoked the birds in order to provide a
distraction against the Reformists in the area.

## The Old Barn

A dilapidated barn with large sturdy hardwood doors. It contained a large
three-headed hound that was chained to the wall by the Reformists that took over
the abandoned settlement.

## Ghoul Food Storage

There were two large abandoned buildings in the settlement that had been used to
house "food" for the ghouls. This food was apparently mind-addled people that
were kidnapped by the Reformists in order to feed the ghouls that they used to
patrol the area.

## The Mine Entrance

The entrance to the mine was a large cave that were guarded by Reformists and
their "pet" ghouls. Sirra Kita and Lavaland were able to explore the mine, but
did not find anything.

## The Windmill

An old windmill with a strong, shackled door. Where the blades of the windmill
once spun, is now a gargantuan black-purple [Orb of Enchancement](@/misc/orbs-of-power/orb-of-endowment.md).

## Abandoned Houses

Abandoned homes of the miners that once lived in the settlement. When Lt.
Westfall explored the area, they were repurposed as housing for Reformist
spellcasters.
