The Brams River begins in the Ranterg Mountains, flowing eastward through
Senera's interior before splitting around
[Surrey-on-the-Brams](@/locations/surrey-on-the-brams.md) and emptying into the
[Gulf of Inespell](@/locations/gulf-of-inespell.md).

## Etymology

The name "Brams" derives from the Hick phrase "bram-aes" meaning "tidal outflow"
or "where-sea-comes," reflecting its historical importance as both a trade route
and sacred waterway to the pre-Kalassarian inhabitants of Senera.

## Geography

### Headwaters

The river's source lies in the Ranterg Mountains, where ancient Hick settlements
established important tidal observation points. These mountains feed the river
through seasonal meltwaters and numerous springs.

### Major Channels

Near its mouth, the river divides into two primary channels around
Surrey-on-the-Brams:

#### Greater Surrey Reach

- Primary maritime artery for international trade
- Depths of 45-60 feet at mean low water
- Nearly half-mile navigable width
- Accommodates largest vessels in Sarmatian trade
- Subject to strong tidal currents up to six knots

#### Bramsward Way

- Services coastal trade and regional traffic
- Depths between 20-30 feet
- More sheltered passage
- Preferred by fishing fleets and coastal traders
- Requires careful navigation through narrow passages

## Historical Significance

### Pre-Kalassarian Era

- Sacred waterway in Hick culture
- Major settlements at strategic confluences
- Important tidal observation points
- Center of maritime traditions

### Kalassarian Period

- Integrated into imperial maritime network
- Development of major port facilities
- Establishment of Surrey-on-the-Brams

### Modern Era

- Critical maritime trade route
- Under strict naval control from Port Surrey
- Key to Senera's maritime dominance
- Protected under Treaty of Turain provisions

## Navigation

The river requires experienced pilots, particularly in its lower reaches where
tidal influences and complex currents demand intimate knowledge of local
conditions. The Port Authority maintains strict regulations on navigation,
especially around Surrey-on-the-Brams where commercial and military traffic
converge.
