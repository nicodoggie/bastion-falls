# History

## Pre-Kalassarian Era

### Early Hick Period (Before 110 AI)

Archaeological evidence suggests the indigenous Hick peoples developed
sophisticated maritime and forestry traditions long before Kalassarian contact.
Ancient stone arrangements and harbor structures indicate advanced understanding
of tides, astronomy, and navigation. The [Keelswood](@/locations/keelswood.md)
preserves evidence of their sophisticated forestry management techniques.

Ruins and artifacts from this period hint at conflicts with an unknown maritime
power, possibly explaining the Hicks' development of sophisticated coastal
defenses and navigation techniques. By the Late Hick period, their society had
divided between coastal iron-working communities and inland traditional
settlements.

### The Brams River Settlements

The [Brams River](@/locations/brams-river.md) held particular significance in
Hick culture. Its name derives from the ancient Hick phrase "Bram-aes"
("where-sea-comes"), reflecting its importance as both a trade route and sacred
waterway. Major settlements developed along its course, particularly at
strategic confluences and tidal observation points.

### Maritime Heritage

Early Seneran seafaring demonstrated remarkable sophistication in tide-reading
and astronomical navigation. The
[Gulf of Inespell](@/locations/gulf-of-inespell.md) was particularly important
to Hick maritime activities, though many of their practices were later
suppressed or adapted during the Kalassarian period.

## Kalassarian Period (110-466 AI)

During the
[Western Kalassarian Empire](@/organizations/western-kalassarian-empire.md)'s
height, Senera served as a crucial naval base in the empire's western maritime
frontier. As an island prefecture, it maintained both magically-powered
transportation networks (enabled by [Ritma](@/world-novelty/ritma.md)) and
conventional maritime routes.

The decline of Ritma from the 3rd century (~200s) onward reshaped this
relationship. While other imperial regions struggled with the loss of
magically-enhanced logistics and communication, Senera's established maritime
infrastructure allowed it to maintain relatively stable governance.

When [Kalassus](@/locations/kalassus.md) fell in 466, Senera was uniquely
positioned to transition smoothly into independence, only formally declaring
itself a kingdom after the fall of the
[Potol region](@/locations/tanduaria.md#kalassarian-potol) to the
[Tandoor](@/ethnicities/tandoor.md).

## Rise of the Maidenfeld Dynasty (Late 460s)

The [House of Maidenfeld](@/families/maidenfeld.md) emerged from the ranks of
Kalassarian naval administrators who had governed Senera's maritime prefecture.
Unlike the violent transitions in many post-Kalassarian territories, their
ascension represented a gradual shift from imperial bureaucracy to sovereign
authority.

### Administrative Continuity

The Maidenfelds maintained much of the existing Kalassarian administrative
structure, particularly:

- The naval command hierarchy
- Port administration systems
- Tax collection mechanisms
- Agricultural management
- Maritime trade regulations

Their legitimacy stemmed from their ability to preserve these institutions while
other regions collapsed into chaos. The nobility largely emerged from former
Kalassarian officials who had maintained control over key infrastructure and
trade routes during the transition.

### Maritime Aristocracy

Seneran aristocracy developed distinct characteristics from mainland nobles:

- Titles often tied to naval responsibilities
- Hereditary port administration rights
- Maritime trade privileges
- Coastal defense obligations
- Ship-building responsibilities

Their close relationship with [Sanery](@/locations/sanery.md), which maintained
similar administrative continuity, allowed both regions to preserve much of
their shared Kalassarian heritage while developing distinct maritime traditions.

### The Dragonheart Transition

The [House of Dragonheart](@/families/dragonheart.md)'s rise to power came
through a combination of naval prestige and marriage alliances with powerful
merchant families. Unlike the bureaucratic Maidenfelds, they represented a more
militant faction of the maritime aristocracy, advocating for aggressive
expansion of Seneran influence.

## Maritime Expansion and Continental Ambitions

The fragmentation of the [Hapgarian region](@/locations/hapgaria.md) created new
political dynamics. While [Baraon](@/locations/baraon.md) descended into
rebellion and famine in the 440s, Senera's maritime connections initially helped
it avoid the worst of the crisis. The Maidenfelds capitalized on this stability
to establish their spice trade networks.

The rise of the [House of Dragonheart](@/families/dragonheart.md) marked a shift
toward more aggressive continental ambitions. This culminated in failed military
campaigns during the 900s, where two successive Seneran kings attempted to
expand territories southward and eastward. These campaigns proved costly,
leading to widespread disillusionment among the nobility who had financed them.

## Modern Era (1225-Present)

The Fall of Bastion in 1225 marked the gradual return of Ritma to the world.
When the [Poasan-Apgarian Conflict](@/events/poasan-apgarian-conflict.md)
erupted as the first major conflict of this new magical era, Senera saw an
opportunity to pursue its long-dormant territorial ambitions.

Through the [Treaty of Turain](@/events/treaty-of-turain.md), Senera secured
significant control over maritime trade routes, establishing itself as a
dominant naval power in the region.

## Religion

### Orthodox Divine Masochism

The state religion since mid-2nd century AI, Orthodox Divine Masochism pervades
all aspects of Seneran society. The conversion from Kalassarian paganism was
systematic and complete, with traditional practices strictly outlawed.
