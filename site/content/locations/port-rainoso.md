{{ incomplete() }}

Port Rainoso is the largest settlement and capital township of
[Raibon Island](@/locations/raibon-island.md). The island itself is administered
by the mayor and town council of Rainoso, and is fairly independent from the
government of its nominal [province of Sanery](@/locations/sanery.md), whose
administrative center is in mainland Apgar.

Rainoso's importance is tied to the
[Heimann Sound](@/locations/heimann-sound.md), the southern mouth of
[Samain River](@/locations/samain-river.md), which can accommodate a large
volume of shipping to the north. The port town, because of this, houses a number
of satellite offices of prominent trading companies from the
[Posaran Sea](@/locations/posaran-sea.md) region, notably the
[Mirian Trading Company](@/organizations/mirian-trading-company.md), which holds
a near-monopoly of the Posaran sea trade.

# History

## Old Estregan Pocham

The Hausi people of present-day Raibon Island started a settlement on the
western banks of the Heimann Sound, which they called _Pocham_. The settlement
was primarily a fishing village ane a hub for early trade between the maritime
communities of the [L'Ille Apgarie](@/locations/l-illes-apgarie.md) archipelago.

They were subservient to the White Witches of the
[Town of Hama](@/locations/hama.md), who were the dominant power in the islands.

## Kalassarian Possam

When the Kalassarians arrived on the island they called _Mausia_, they were
allowed to make a settlement themselves across the Sound. The settlement was
called Eastern Possam, and was established as an outpost and secondary port that
connected Seneria to the rest of the Beteran continent. This settlement did not
garner much interest due to the fact that magical transportation was used more
extensively, and sea travel was not as important as it once was.

Eventually, by the
[Fall of the Kalassarian Empire](@/events/fall-of-the-kalassarian-empire.md),
the settlement was abandoned and was settled by the local Hausi people.

## Resettlement by the Kingdom of Estrega

The Silver Kingdoms largely ignored the islands of the L'Ille Apgarie
archipelago for centuries, due to the protection of the White Witches of Hama.
The sinking of the Town of Hama in 910 AI, however, left the islands vulnerable.

During the intervening years, the islands were claimed by a number of the Silver
Kingdoms, who each declared the islands to be part of their realm.

The Kingdom of Estrega, however, was the first to send a permanent settlement to
the islands. In 961 AI, the islands were claimed by the Kingdom of Estrega, and
the original Pocham settlement was razed to the ground. In its place, Port
Rainoso was founded.

## Renaming as Raibon Island

In 970 AI, the islands were renamed in honor of King Raibon II of Estrega, who
had died the previous year. The settlement was renamed to Raibon Island, and its
Port Rainoso officially became the capital of the island, with local
administration buildings built, and local magistrates appointed.

# Administration

## Minervan Office (Executive Branch)

### Mayor

The Mayoral office is an elected position that is responsible for the day-to-day
operations of the local government. They ensure that local and confederate laws
are executed, and that the local government is run efficiently and effectively.

The current Mayor as if 1275 AI is
[Guy Rabespierre](@/characters/guy-rabespierre.md).

### Vice-Mayor

The Vice-Mayor is selected by the Mayor as a running-mate, and acts as a
fallback if the Mayor is deemed unfit to run office. They also officiate the
meetings of the Justician Council as its prime speaker. Typically, the Vice
Mayor has no vote in the Council, except to break ties in simple majority votes.

The current Vice-Mayor is [Degare Durant](@/characters/degare-durant.md).

### Ministers

These ministers are appointed by the Mayor, and are responsible for specific
departments of the local government. Currently, there are 4 ministers:

The Mayor may create new temporary ministries as needed, and may appoint
additional ministers to oversee them, however, they may only last 1 year at most
before they must be dissolved. Motions for extension may be granted by the
Justician Council on a case-by-case basis. These offices may also be ratified as
permanent institutions by the Justician Council through regular legislation.

## Justician Council (Legislative and Judicial Branch)

### Justician Council

The Justician Council is both the legislature and the judiciary of the local
government. Its membership is divided into two houses: the Drafters and the
Justices. Pieces of legislation may be proposed by either of the two houses, and
are first deliberated separately. If a bill passes both houses, it is then sent
to the Mayor for ratification. High profile cases where questions of law are
complex are also tried and deliberated by the whole Council, usually with a
designated Justice taking the lead.

#### Drafters

Drafters are an elected position from amongst the citizens of a municipality or
a district within that municipality. These Drafters are tasked with proposing
new legislature based on the needs of their constituents and specific mandates.
