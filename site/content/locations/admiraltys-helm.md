## Geography

The district occupies approximately 20 square miles atop a natural plateau,
rising several hundred feet above the water. Steep cliffs on three sides provide
natural defenses, while the protected [the Keelswood](@/locations/keelswood.md)
covers much of the remaining terrain.

## The Fortress

### Early Fortifications

The original pre-Kalassarian fort occupied the highest point of the Crow's Nest,
offering views of both river approaches. Archaeological evidence suggests a
simple stone keep with wooden outer defenses.

### Kalassarian Citadel

Under Kalassarian rule, the fort was expanded into an extensive citadel using
magical engineering. The enhanced fortifications integrated with the Keelswood's
natural barriers and included:

- Magically reinforced walls
- Enhanced watch towers
- Secure administrative complex
- Protected harbor access

### Modern Naval Command

Following the Silent Ages, the fortress was adapted for the Seneran Navy's needs
while maintaining its defensive capabilities. The current complex includes:

#### Central Keep

- Naval High Command offices
- Strategic planning facilities
- Secure communication center
- Historical archives

#### Inner Bailey

- Administrative buildings
- Officer quarters
- Tactical facilities
- Secure meeting rooms

#### Outer Bailey

- Support facilities
- Training grounds
- Supply warehouses
- Maintenance workshops

### Modern Naval Complex

The fortress complex occupies the northern portion of the plateau, housing the
Navy's highest command functions and strategic facilities. Unlike the larger
naval installations at river level, this complex focuses on command, control,
and security rather than day-to-day operations.

#### Central Keep

The ancient keep, rising several stories above the surrounding complex, houses
the Navy's highest functions. Its thick stone walls, originally designed for
defense, now protect sensitive communications and strategic planning. The
structure has been internally renovated multiple times while maintaining its
imposing external appearance.

##### Admiral's Tower

The keep's most distinctive feature is the Admiral's Tower, rising from its
northwestern corner. This octagonal structure, originally built during the
Kalassarian era, once featured massive glass windows that provided clear,
protected views in any weather. The loss of these windows during the Silent Ages
led to numerous adaptations:

- Original window frames now fitted with:
  - Wooden shutters for storm protection
  - Canvas screens to break the wind
  - Oiled parchment in some sections for light
  - Removable wooden panels for different seasons

The tower's distinctive arched openings, clearly designed for much grander
windows, hint at its former glory. Yet the current arrangements have proven
practical, allowing watch crews to:

- Monitor vessel movements in both channels
- Observe weather conditions developing over the gulf
- Track naval exercises
- Coordinate harbor defense
- Maintain visual communication with ships via signal flags

The tower remains both a strategic observation post and a symbol of naval
authority, though its current state serves as a reminder of lost Kalassarian
achievements.

###### Command Chambers

Below the Admiral's Tower, the keep's upper floors house the Navy's most
sensitive command facilities. The thick stone walls, originally designed to
withstand siege weapons, now ensure absolute privacy for:

- High Command meeting rooms
- Strategic planning chambers
- Admiral's private offices
- Secure document rooms
- Emergency command post

###### Signal Office

Occupying the eastern wing of the keep's upper level, the Signal Office
coordinates all naval communications. Its position allows direct access to:

- Flag signaling stations
- Message dispatch center
- Courier offices
- Code rooms
- Weather monitoring station

###### Archives

The keep's lower levels contain the Navy's historical records, protected by the
same massive walls that once guarded the fortress treasury. These chambers
house:

- Naval operations records
- Ship registries and logs
- Personnel files
- Strategic maps and charts
- Historical documents

###### Great Hall

The heart of the Central Keep's main level, the Great Hall serves both
ceremonial and practical functions. This vast chamber, with its vaulted stone
ceiling and massive supporting columns, hosts:

####### Ceremonial Functions

- Officer commissioning ceremonies
- Strategic briefings
- Diplomatic receptions
- Awards presentations
- Memorial services

####### Daily Operations

- Morning officer assemblies
- Shift change briefings
- Emergency mustering point
- Weather shelter during drills
- Informal meeting space

####### Features

- Ancient stone fireplace large enough to warm the entire space
- Raised dais for formal addresses
- Gallery level accessed by twin stone staircases
- Wall-mounted honor rolls of distinguished service
- Naval battle tapestries and paintings
- Commemorative plaques from notable engagements
- Strategic maps displayed behind protective screens
- Traditional ship's bell used for ceremonies

The hall's impressive scale and austere decoration reflect both its military
purpose and historical significance, while its practical layout continues to
serve the modern navy's needs.

#### Inner Bailey

Surrounding the keep, the inner bailey contains the more sensitive
administrative functions. Modern buildings, constructed within the original
defensive walls, house various command departments and secure facilities.
Officer quarters occupy several restored historical structures, maintaining a
connection to the fortress's past.

##### Liaison Office of the Treaty of Turain Organization

This office serves as the primary point of contact between the Seneran Navy and
the Treaty of Turain Organization. It facilitates communication and coordination
regarding treaty enforcement and compliance. The office is staffed by diplomatic
and military personnel who work closely with naval command to ensure adherence
to treaty provisions and to address any disputes or issues that arise.

#### Outer Bailey

The outer bailey serves as the complex's operational hub. Newer, purpose-built
structures house everything from training facilities to supply management. This
area sees the most daily activity, with personnel and supplies moving between
various facilities.

##### Garrison Quarter

The northern section houses enlisted personnel and guard facilities:

- Barracks blocks for permanent garrison
- Guard posts and armories
- Training yards and drill grounds
- Mess halls and kitchens
- Recreation facilities

## Access and Security

### Natural Pathways

The cliff faces, while formidable, feature several natural formations that have
been developed into access routes:

- Broad spiral paths following natural rock formations
- Gradual switchbacks along geological terraces
- Ancient water-carved galleries, now roofed and protected
- Natural caves and passages expanded for use
- Drainage channels following original water flows

These paths, enhanced and fortified over centuries, serve as the primary access
routes between the plateau and river level. Their seemingly natural integration
with the terrain has led some scholars to suggest they originated from
prehistoric river erosion patterns.

### Modern Access

- Main approach road from Tidemark District
- Developed spiral paths to river level
- Protected switchback routes
- Mechanical lift systems (recent additions)
- Emergency evacuation tunnels
- Watch posts overlooking both channels

### Supply Lines

- Mule trains using established paths
- Modern mechanical assistance where possible
- Strategic supply caches
- Water management systems
- Granaries and cisterns

While the district's elevation presents significant logistical challenges, these
ancient routes provide reliable access for both routine supplies and military
movements.

### Lift Systems

The late Silent Ages saw the addition of several mechanical lift systems to ease
the burden of constant supply transport. These ingenious but labor-intensive
systems include:

- The Great Wheel

  - Massive wooden treadwheel powered by prison labor and mules
  - Operates the main cargo lift
  - Can raise several tons of supplies at once
  - Requires teams working in shifts

- The Chain Lifts

  - Series of smaller lifts along the cliff face
  - Each powered by separate teams
  - Used for lighter, urgent cargo
  - More frequent but smaller loads

- Emergency Winches
  - Manually operated backup systems
  - Positioned at strategic points
  - Maintained for crisis situations
  - Require significant manpower to operate

These systems, while primitive compared to modern engineering elsewhere,
represent a significant investment in infrastructure and remain crucial to the
district's daily operations. The labor required to operate them constitutes a
major portion of the prison's work detail assignments.

## Prison Complex

The notorious Admiralty Prison, known colloquially as "The Splits," dominates
the southwestern quarter of the plateau. Its substantial size reflects both its
importance as a military prison and its role in providing labor for the
district's operations.
