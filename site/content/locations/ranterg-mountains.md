The **Ranterg Mountains** (from Hick "thrantorgral" - "thousand stone peaks")
form the central spine of Senera, running roughly north-south through the
island's interior. The range serves as the source of the
[Brams River](@/locations/brams-river.md) and historically marked the boundary
between coastal and inland Hick settlements.

## Etymology

The modern name "Ranterg" evolved from the Hick compound "thrantorgral" through
a series of sound changes:

- Early Seneran: [θran.tor.gral] → [ran.tor.gal]
- Middle Seneran: [ran.ter.gəl]
- Modern Seneran: [ran.terg]
