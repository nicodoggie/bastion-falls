Southern Poasah is a region in the western portion of the Mirian Peninsula,
bounded by the [Longissian Mountains](@/locations/longissian-mountains.md) to
the east. This mountain range forms the natural border between Southern Poasah
and [Kolha](@/locations/kolha.md).

The region's position west of the Longissian Mountains has historically
influenced its political and cultural development, distinct from the Kolhan
territories to the east of the range.
