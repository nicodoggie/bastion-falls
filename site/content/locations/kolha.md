Kolha occupies the eastern portion of the Mirian Peninsula, bounded by the [Longissian 
Mountains](@/locations/longissian-mountains.md) to the west. These mountains form the 
natural border between Kolha and [Southern Poasah](@/locations/southern-poasah.md).

# History

## Rise to Power
Under [Kolha I](@/characters/kolha-i.md), the region became a crucial part of the 
[Ahurian Empire](@/locations/ahuria.md)'s expansion. In 466 AI, Kolha I led Ahurian 
forces in the [Kolhan Invasion](@/events/kolhan-invasion.md), which culminated in the 
razing of the city of Kalassus.

## Modern Era
As a principality of the Ahurian Empire, Kolha continues to be an integral part of 
Ahuria. The Revolt of the Kolhan Ansa (1250-1254 AI), triggered by the death of 
Prince Kolha XVIII, resulted in several territories seceding from Kolha to form 
independent principalities separate from Ahurian control.
