The Mirian Peninsula is a major landmass bounded by the
[Parnassus Mountains](@/locations/parnassus-mountains.md) to the north. The
peninsula is bisected by the
[Longissian Mountains](@/locations/longissian-mountains.md), which run
north-south and form the natural border between
[Southern Poasah](@/locations/southern-poasah.md) in the west and
[Kolha](@/locations/kolha.md) in the east.

Historically, this peninsula was known as the Land of Mir in the
[Kalassus Foundation Myth](@/world-novelty/kalassus-foundation-myth.md), and was
the birthplace of Kalassarian civilization.
