The Longissian Mountains are a major north-south mountain range that bisects the
Mirian Peninsula, forming the natural border between present-day
[Kolha](@/locations/kolha.md) and [Southern Poasah](@/locations/southern-poasah.md).

Historically, these mountains were home to
[Kureran](@/ethnicities/koradin-kurerans.md) settlements, referenced in the
[Kalassus Foundation Myth](@/world-novelty/kalassus-foundation-myth.md) as the
home of the "Magi Diminuti."
