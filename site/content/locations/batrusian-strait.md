The Batrusian Straits are a strategic waterway that connected the eastern and
western portions of the Kalassarian Empire. The straits are marked by two
significant islands: [Calamutz](@/locations/calamutz.md) at the southern mouth
and [other island name] at the northern entrance.

## Historical Significance

The straits gained particular importance in 627 AI when Calamutz declared its
independence under King Cala I, establishing control over the southern maritime
trade routes. This position would prove crucial during the Fracturing of the
Eastern Kalassarian Empire in 670 AI.
