# Corrida

The country of Corrida, so named because it was a corridor between the [Marmorantz](@/locations/marmoranz.md) mountain range to the north, and the [Mauh](@/locations/mauh.md) mountain range to the south.

The landscape is dotted by many basins, waterfalls, cliffsides, and evergreen woodlands. It was a great valley with a number of rivers and tributaries to the Great River [Loasnah](@/locations/loasnah.md) that flowed east to west down until the [Sea of Estrus](@/locations/sea-of-estrus.md), through the [Kingdom of Nura](@/locations/nura.md).

Corrida did not have a formal central government, but was ruled by many smaller polises with a shared cultural identity.
