_The Travertines_ are the headwaters of the Malter River, and are called such
due to the nearby travertine formations atop large basalt fissure formations
where the river proper emerges. Th travertine formations are a series of
delicate, striated formations of limestone, which are a result of the water
seeping through the basalt and depositing calcium carbonate as it flows over the
surface.

This Kalassarian form of its original name _Asatogar_, also lends its name to
the local viscounty of _Travertine_. Its rulers are considered the wardens of
the southern tip of the Maltrek mountain range, and manage the limestone, marble
and basalt quarries of the lower Maltrek region.
