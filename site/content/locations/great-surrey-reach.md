The Great Surrey Reach is the primary maritime artery connecting the
[Brams River](@/locations/brams-river.md) to the
[Gulf of Inespell](@/locations/gulf-of-inespell.md). This deep-water channel
forms the northern fork of the river's delta, separating
[Surrey-on-the-Brams](@/locations/surrey-on-the-brams.md) and
[Surrey's East](@/locations/surreys-east.md) from the Seneran mainland.

## Maritime Significance

The Reach serves as the main shipping channel for international trade and naval
operations, with depths ranging from 45 to 60 feet at mean low water and a
navigable width of nearly half a mile. Where it meets the gulf, the channel
widens into a natural deep-water roadstead, offering protected anchorage for
large vessels.

### Navigation Hazards

Several notable hazards require careful pilotage:

#### Natural Features

- Dragon's Teeth: Jagged rocks exposed at low tide near the gulf entrance
- Complex tidal interactions between river current and gulf waters
- Standing waves during ebb tides when strong southwesterly winds oppose the
  current

#### Artificial Features

- Ballast Banks: Centuries of accumulated ship's ballast creating shoals along
  the northern bank
- Strictly regulated ballast disposal points
- Maintained channels through hazardous waters

### Maritime Control

The Reach functions as a transitional zone under
[Port Surrey-on-the-Brams'](@/locations/port-surrey-on-the-brams.md) authority,
where:

- All vessels must submit to inspection
- Multiple inspection anchorages maintain commercial flow
- Customs officers conduct examinations
- Intelligence agents monitor for treaty violations
- Licensed pilot services guide vessels

## Strategic Importance

### Military Oversight

- Artillery batteries along both shores
- Anti-ship emplacements with overlapping fields of fire
- Quick-response naval squadrons
- Coastal watch stations
- Deep-water patrol zones

### Northern Shore

- Natural deep-water berths
- Ancient Kalassarian stone wharves
- Modern port facilities
- Military installations
- Customs checkpoints
