According to the [Kalassus Foundation Myth](@/world-novelty/kalassus-foundation-myth.md), 
the River Diber flows from the Parnassus Mountains, across the land of Mir (present-day 
[Mirian Peninsula](@/locations/mirian-peninsula.md)), through what would become the 
city of Kalassus. The myth states that the river was formed from the tears of joy shed 
by the mountain folk after their liberation from Parnassus Rex Victorinus.
