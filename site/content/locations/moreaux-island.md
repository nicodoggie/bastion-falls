An island within L'Illes Apgarie, _Moreaux Island_ was made famous by reports of
a tribe of raiding cannibals residing within. Popularized by the
much-republished reports by noted anthropologist
[Andr√© Arquette](@/characters/andre-arquette.md), people in the
[Apgarian Confederacy](@/organizations/apgarian-confederacy.md) were stunned by
the revelation that such a culture existed within their midst.

Further attempts to communicate with the island's inhabitants had all ended in
tragedy. Most people were killed and eaten, as reported by a small number of
survivors.

## Geography

The island itself is quite small with a radius of about 5 miles at high tide. A
coastline of about one mile is revealed when the tides recede, covered in a
mangrove forest. The shallow and rocky coastline makes it difficult for ships to
moor close to the ground and would make any visitor vulnerable to assaults.

## Fauna

Most animals within Moreaux Island are small rodents that may burrow in the
ground and a few amphibious species that are insectivorous.

The mangroves are home to a number of insect communities and mollusks. Migratory
birds also often use the island as a resting ground.

## Flora

Plants on the island are those that have adapted to a saline environment, like
mangroves and seagrass. Few of them are edible, but may help with seasoning, and
have some medicinal properties.

A number of edible mushrooms and lichen exist on the island, and are cultivated
by the natives for food and religious rituals. A specific red-capped mushroom
endemic to the island, in particular, is exclusively used for the rituals
associated with their cannibalistic practices.

## Mundaguk People

Mundaguk people are what the natives call themselves in their local vernacular,
which seems to be related to Old Estagon in some respects. Colloquially, due to
the success of Dr. Arquette's book, they are known as the
_[Monsters of Moreaux Island](@/misc/monsters-of-moreaux-island.md).

They are a single community of about 150 people at the time of their discovery
in 1269 AI who inhabit the island. They have limited seafaring abilities, but do
have rafts to fish in nearby atolls. Despite their popular depiction, a careful
reading of the text shows that their community is usually quite docile until
they are either confronted by an external threat such as interlopers, or an
internal power struggle. Both events seem to be fueled by the ingestion of a
local mushroom that enhances aggressive behavior and physical qualities.

Their weapons are quite basic offensive tools made from wood, rock and bone.
They have stone/flint knives, simple bows and arrows, clubs and other primitive
implements.
