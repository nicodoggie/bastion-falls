title = "Day of First Sprout"
+++

Day of First Sprout (Early Hick: sinthir sarespul thrales) was the traditional
celebration of the beginning of the new year at the first sprout of spring. The
practice was supplanted after the widespread adoption of the Kalassarian
calendar following the Kalassarian Invasion of Senera in 105 AI.

During the Winter Solstice celebrations, the Malthrenok of a Hick tribe would
divine when and where the first sprout would emerge. The Malthrenok would then
announce the date of the Day of First Sprout to the tribe.

Upon the day itself, the tribe would gather at the Malthrenok's home, where they
would begin their pilgrimage to the site of the first sprout. The journey would
be marked with merrymaking and the consumption of a traditional meal made with
young venison meat wrapped in a flattened sourdough bread.

Once the pilgrims arrived at the site of the first sprout, they would perform a
ritual dance to celebrate the beginning of the new year. The dance was performed
in a circle, with the participants holding hands and moving in a clockwise
direction. The dance was accompanied by the playing of a drum and the singing of
a traditional song.

After the dance, the pilgrims would return to the village square, where they
would consume the contents of the gourds they've received a part of the
_'irurlises duwesimris_ given during the winter solstice celebrations.
