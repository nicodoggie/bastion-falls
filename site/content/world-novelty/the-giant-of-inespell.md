title = "The Giant of Inespell"

+++

In the great past, before the Greater Tribe knew of grain and ale.  
Before the cow and the horse grazed the meadows of Rannek,  
Our people herded goats and marched with the seasons.  

Upon the Northern Lights, they came
Riding the Northern Winds, they came.
The Eldrim they called themselves.
And at first, we loved them.

They taught us of metals and the forge
We taught them our stars and our sky

They taught us to shape the stone
We taught them to sail our waters

They taught us to color the flowers
We taught them to make them bloom

Then they taught us glamour
We taught them the ways of our world

For all their haughtiness, they were not our masters
They were as brothers, we were kin
But as brothers do, we often did fight

It has come to pass that their true selves were shown
Interlopers who covet our lands
For while they thought themselves great, they lost their own

But as they learned our ways, they grew strong
And their glamour was beyond our own
In each battle, we grew desperate

By inch and by furlong, we lost our lands
And the Eldrim, strong as they are
We grew small underneath their yoke

But for all that they taught
they did not teach us of iron
For iron was their bane

Iron is now our blessing

The greatest of us, the most learned
With all the glamour ours could muster
We forged with the fires of our mountains a protector

A Giant of Iron, the Giant of Inespell
Guided by our collective rage
Condensed under the cold frozen embers of time

Under the guidance of the Watcher of the Pools
The Giant marched forth against their floating towns
With iron and with fire, it wrought destruction

Those of the Eldrim who though highly of themselves
were then brought low by the Giant's might
And on that day, we taught them of iron and the fire our rage

# Inespell's Giant

in the distant past, before the dawn of the Greater Tribe  
in the distant past, before we knew of grain  
in the distant past, before we knew of ale  

in the distant past, before the cows grazed  
in the distant past, before the horse grazed  
in the distant past, before the great owl flew  

in the distant past, we herded our goats  
we marched with the seasons  
within the meadows of Rannek  

in the distant past, they came to this land  
upon the Northern Lights  
in the distant past, they rode the Northern Winds  
in the distant past, Eldhellen they were called  

in the distant past, we were infatuated with them  

They taught us the forge  
We taught them our stars  

They taught us to craft the stone  
We taught them to sail our waters  

They taught us to color the flowers  
We taught them to make them bloom  

Then they taught us glamour  
We taught them the ways of our world  

Despite their haughtiness, we were not beneath them  
We were as kin  
As kin does, we often fought  

they have showed their true selves
invaders who want our lands
