A typical sociolinguistic element in the Western Beteran languages is the
metaphorical association of the Aurorae as a bridge between worlds. Whlie the
realization of the concept in various folklore have clear differences, the
concept itself is common to most Western Beteran languages.

Northern Apgarian folklore mentions that the colors of the Aurorae show which
entities are traveling between the worlds during the celestial events.

Hickic folklore specifically calls the Lights as the Elven Bridge, 'eldegralen
asadimris. They say that the Elves, along with many fey creatures, traveled the
bridge to escape calamity.
