From upon the Mighty Parnassus, Parnassus Rex Victorinus waged war against the hardy
folk of the Tarn. Years have those wars been waged, until on the Eleventh month
of the Eleventh year, Parnassus Rex Victorinus conquered all of the mountains. As
Mountain King, Victorinus demanded tribute from them: 11 sets of 11 bushels of
the finest meats, the most lustrous of metals, and the sweetest of meads from
all under his dominion, except for one.

From Tarnum, he demanded its King's second daughter as tribute. Appia Tarnum, on
her eleventh nameday, was given to Parnassus Rex. Under the Parnian King's
command, Appia was given every luxury, every comfort as she was favored above
any of this many concubines.

It would come to pass that Appia would bear the Parnian king's child, named
after the Great Bear Kala, due to his great wails that roar like the mighty
bears of the Parna. On his tenth nameday, now called Kalassus Regulus, his
renown in armed combat was spread across the mountains. Able to best ten men at
once, could he. And Parnassus Rex was pleased.

But on his eleventh nameday, upon the eleventh hour, the Auguries of the Goddess
of Civilization foretold that on the sixteenth year past his birth, Kalassus
would lead great armies against his own father. He himself would put the head of
the mighty Parnassus Rex upon a pike and march it with his host as he claimed
all the mountains as his own. All would hail Kalassus Rex Regum, King of Kings,
for ten upon ten upon ten years.

Parnassus was distraught. He could not allow his throne to be usurped, but he
could neither bear to slay his own son. Instead he commanded his closest
confidants, those of his guard, to ensure the auguries do not come to pass.

All the while, Appia still bore hatred for the man who took her from her home.
She had ears within the palace walls as she waited for an opportune moment to
free herself from the freezing Parnian court. She heard of the auguries, and of
the command given to the guard. They were to poison his meals with hemlock,
slowly weakening him until he was too weak to rise.

With haste, Appia entreated her son to flee with her, away from the court of the
Mountain King. The guard was alerted to their flight, and would scour the land
for Kalassus and his mother.

The guard would call for the King's equestrians whose great steeds could scale
the steepest of mountains. They would ride forth to catch the fleeing pair,
following their tracks to the foot of Mount Femuria, on the southern-most tip of
the Parnassus.

Appia secured a carriage among a caravan to the land of Mir, south of the
mountains to live hidden from the reach of the Mountain King. But the King's
equestrians were clever, and would find the carriage. However Appia was cleverer
still! She had disguised a homeless boy with her son's clothing and likeness,
while Kalassus worked as a caravan guard, wearing commoner's trappings and hide.

Kalassus lamented the loss of his mother, and the sacrifice of the boy. But he
rode forth as a guard to relatives of the Queen of Lavinia, and escorted them
back to their lands within the Mir.

It was on this journey that the caravan was beset by jackals. The beasts were
feral and starving, savaging the caravan guards with a desperate ferocity. But
among them was Kalassus who fought with a matching wild fury. To his surprise,
his spear, nor the spears of his fellow guardsmen would not pierce the beasts.

These were no mere jackals, but fey creatures glamoured with the magic of
faeries. By sheer chance, Kalassus would draw his iron dagger as his spear shaft
split in twain. As the other guardsmen were felled one by one, a heavily wounded
Kalassus valiantly fought the mighty pack to all but his last breath.
Victorious, but the brunt of his wounds would render him close to unconscious.

The jackals circled the beleaguered Kalassus, with full intention to rip off his
throat. As one of the canines leapt for the final blow, every single one of them
were frozen as if time itself had stopped. Fabled masters of the arcane arts,
the Magi Diminuti, as they were called by the mountain folk, were moving their
hands in incomprehensible patterns. One of them approached Kalassus, and with a
single touch, enveloped him in a soothing warmth. To his surprise, not only did
his wounds start to close, but he floated up into the air as if he were upon
water. Then he was moved, without any apparent guidance as he completely lost
consciousness

As he awoke, Kalassus found himself in the halls of the Kurerans of Longossus.
Those that the mountain folk called the Magi Diminuti. They saw great potential
in the young boy and raised him in their stone halls underneath the Longissian
Mountains that bordered the west of the land of Mir.

Within those halls, Kalassus was taught the secrets of the Ritma--a discipline
and a language that gave the Kurerans access to the raw magics of the world.
They told him that these would allow him to attune to the Rhythmes of the
Planes, and would grant him the power to perform great miracles.

As he grew in age and in power, Kalassus would also grow in anger as he would
see for himself what the Auguries have divined. He would judge that the
short-sightedness of his father had cause the needless death and suffering of
his poor mother and vowed revenge.

On his twelfth nameday, Kalassus would leave the halls of the Kurerans, and
would ride forth to claim his birthright. In order to do so, he would travel to
the court of Lavinia Regina Maxima for aid. He regaled her of his adversities
and lamentations.

He told her of how his mother thwarted attempts at his life.

He told her of the death of his mother at the hands of the Mountain King's
equestrians.

He told her of the glamoured jackals that massacred the members of her
relatives' caravan, and how he almost lost his life to save them.

All he asked of her was a century of her finest legionnaires to fulfill the
Augury by his own accord.

The Queen of Lavinia was pleased with his resolve, and with his cause. She would
agree but with a condition: he must serve her for eleven upon eleven upon eleven
days. In that time, he must teach her and her magae the secrets of the Ritma. In
turn she would grant him her legions.

Kalassus agreed, and taught the Queen and her magae all that he knew. After
eleven upon eleven days, he and the Queen would fall in love, and Aemillia
Lavinia Regina Maxima would be wed to Kalassus Magus Maximus, the Mage Supreme.

Meanwhile, in these eleven upon eleven upon eleven days, Parnassus Rex would
become indolent, secure in the knowledge that his son would never return, and
his throne remained secure. So it would come to pass that on the day that the
Auguries have foretold, the Lavinian Legions would march forth up the slopes of
the Parnassus. At the head of their host would be the great Lavinian Magae, and
Kalassus himself.

In a display of great skill in the art of Ritma, he would raise his hands as
walls would rise up from the ground to separate the innocent masses apart from
the Mountain King's host. Without hesitation, the Lavinian Legions would
slaughter those loyal to Parnassus Rex as they clashed within the stone walls.

As the battle ensued, Kalassus, his voice amplified by spirits of the mountains
themselves, spoke with a thunderous force:

> O those of you who are yet bound  
> By chains of tyranny, shackled  
> Slaves to the Mad King of Parna  
> You shall be set free, chains broken!  
> Hark! Behold! He who was foretold!  
> Favored by Minerva herself  
> Here I come for the tyrant's head  
> Whose maleficence I'm to end.

A rain of blades and arrows poured, and balls of fire roasted the Mountain
King's host. Each one given a mercifully swift end as they marched ever closer
to the throne that Parnassus Rex hid behind. At the threshold, the voice of
Kalassus once again boomed forth:

> Woe to thee father, once revered Unwitting to the Augur's Curse As thou tried
> to snap at mine throat As thou killed she, thou claimed to love Ensnared
> thyself in Fate's cruel trap For if thou had used thine good sense If thou
> hadst stayed thy murdrous hand What comes today might not have come. For an
> Augur may see but one A single branch amidst the trees Thy hast chosen to
> climb one broken This augury seen through thine eyes Eyes of one treacherous
> and blind Chose to kill the stead of love Thou is laden on broken branch So by
> thine own kin, thou shalt fall

As that final word echoed across the mountains, the soul of Parnassus Rex itself
untethered itself from his body. That which linked them together was severed by
the harshness of the word as it was carried into the wind by the powerful tone
of the Ritma.

So it came to pass that Parnassus Rex, the Mountain King, was no more. The
mountain folk wept in glee as they beheld the head of their tyrant mounted on a
pike at the head of thost of Kalassus Rex Regum, King of Kings.

The tears grew into the mighty river Diber which flowed from Parnassus, across
the land of Mir, through the heart of the city of Lavinia. Kalassus would ride
down the river triumphant, with the innocent masses with him into the city of
his great love.

Upon their reunion, Queen Aemillia Lavinia Regina would bow to her husband, and
King of Kings. She would declare the land to be called Kalassus in honor of his
triumph and great return. For tens upon tens upon tens of years, their land
would rule all the world.
