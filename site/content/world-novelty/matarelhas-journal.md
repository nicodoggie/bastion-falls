# 15th Sorhima of the 66th Year of the Reign of Sorha XXIII

Lady Faivalkhari is still, after one year of my tutelage, a bit on the shy side. Slowly, however, she has made steady progress.

Today, her older brother Polhenma, the magistrate of Khan[^1], visited the capital[^2] and brought with him his retinue. Instead of shutting herself in her room, Fai, on her own volition, greeted him and accompanied him during her ceremony[^3].

I am sure she will eventually be freed from her fear of intimacy of even the familiar sort.

How is it that the world of the Ansa is so different from the rest of society? Are the waoos of the palace imbued with the magics of the Gods of Old[^4] that even the air itself transmutes into an atmosphere suitable to the Ansa's desires? How are we, the Ahurikishki priesthood so fortuante so as to be allowed to breathe the same air? Especially when seemingly more worthy people are barred from these halls? The Akkibati who fight to protect our land, the Provobati who craft our wares and build our homes, the Ponsabati who grow our food--all of them who prove their worth day-by-day than we who serve in our position of luxury.

Even one such as I, once a mere tool for the satisfaction of your lords' carnal desires[^5], are elevated, where similar workers who serve men and women of worth, are branded Harsi. My simple proximity to the heirs of the Great Ahuriyata grant me this distinction that would otherwise be derided.

How lucky am I? That I may be selected by the priesthood to pursue scholarship in a field of study, and one of my own choosing? That I may, only a mere months after the completion of my studies, serve at the pleasure of one of the Ansa of the courts as a steward of their exalted child? Then only six months to the day, that I've been entrusted with the care of the daughter of my Prince!

Spring had come somewhat late this year, but it is now definitely in full form. The snow had all but melted, he trees are crowned once more with leaves, the animals are out and about, feeding themselves after a long winter.

On this beautiful day, I would have felt bad if I locked Fai in a dark lecture room. So I had moved our lecture outdoors today.  It was a more impromptu lesson, instead of the one that I had planned. It seemed appropriate for me to tailor my lesson to the setting.

We went to the peach orchard to discuss the change of the seasons, and the natural processes associated with them. Since we are currently experiencing this change, I started with the transition of winter to spring. She seemed to have enjoyed the lesson very much! Her demeanor had definitely shifted from her more brooding, reserved self, to a more cheerful and bright one. We went through each plant and their properties. Each tree and their health. It seemed her joviality was infectious. I swear, the leaves seem to have become greener in her presence!

We went back to the palatial residence[^6], exhausted but, in my opinion, quite fulfilled. I believe I will want to do more of these--perhaps even twice a week, if the weather allows.

The Lunar Festival[^7] is in twelve days, and the preparations are in full swing! High-priest Chian had asked me to begin preparing Faivalhhari for her role as the Spring Lord[^8]--the first prince that taught farming to the Provobati.

*The ink on the page changed shade from a deep crimson to one with a pinkish hue*
But of course, my inkpot ran out at the most inopportune moment. This is a slightly different shade than the one I was using unfortunately...

To continue, the Ansa's first role in the Lunar Festival is a milestone in their special place along the Starlit Path[^8]. She, and by she, I mean Fai, ahd taaken her role very seriously. As soon as I have told her about it, she quickly took to study. Currently, we are dissectiong the first three stanzas of Lansa I's address to her people:

  > You who are hungry, rejoice!\
  > Your hunger will be sated\
  > Our Father hath mandated\
  > He had took heed\
  > His wisdom He bestows to all\
  > Harken, for his words are sacred\
  > 
  > Gather all you men of soil\
  > For you might be put to toil\
  > You are akin to the ripe fruit\
  > Whose seed will spread the fertile land\
  > 
  > Your worth will be proven\
  > For you are the Ponsabati\
  > The men of plenty\
  > And you will feed His men!

She is well on her way to her successful first foray into here deific duties.
