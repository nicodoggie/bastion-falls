You who are hungry, rejoice!\
Your hunger will be sated\
Our Father hath mandated\
He had took heed\
His wisdom He bestows to all\
Harken, for his words are sacred\

Gather all you men of soil\
For you might be put to toil\
You are akin to the ripe fruit\
Whose seed will spread the fertile land\

Your worth will be proven\
For you are the Ponsabati\
The men of plenty\
And you will feed His men
