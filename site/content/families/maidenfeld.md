The *Maidenfeld* family was the founding dynasty of the
[Kingdom of Senera](@/locations/senera.md), which took control of the administration
of the island while the [Kalassarian Empire](@/locations/kalassaria.md) was
deteriorating. Their patriarch,
[Antonius I Maidenfeld](@/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/names.md#antonius-i-maidenfeld),
was a high-ranking administrator in the Kalassarian-held Senerian government,
who took advantage of the attempt to quell the various Hapgarian rebellions to
establish himself as the de facto ruler of the island.

They were eventually supplanted by the currently-ruling [Dragonheart
Dynasty](@/families/dragonheart.md). As a compromise following their defeat in
the [War of Thyme and Fire](@/events/war-of-thyme-and-fire.md), the Maidenfelds
were allowed to retain a portion of their agricultural business ventures. Today,
the Maidenfelds supply for approximately 70% of all rare herbs and spices in
[Western Betera](@/locations/betera/index.md).
