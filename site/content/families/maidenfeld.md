The *Maidenfeld* family were the founding dynasty of the [Kingdom of Senera](@/locations/senera.md) after interregnal years after the [Fall of the Western Kalassarian Empire](@/events/fall-of-the-western-kalassarian-empire.md).

They were eventually supplanted by the currently-ruling [Dragonheart Dynasty](@/families/dragonheart.md). As a compromise following their defeat in the [War of Thyme and Fire](@/events/war-of-thyme-and-fire.md), the Maidenfelds were allowed to retain a portion of their agricultural business ventures. Today, the Maidenfelds supply for approximately 70% of all rare herbs and spices in [Western Betera](@/locations/betera/index.md).
