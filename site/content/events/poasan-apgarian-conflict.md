The _Poasan-Apgarian Conflict_ was a five-year, multi-front war between the
[Apgarian Confederacy](@/organizations/apgarian-confederacy.md) and the
[Divine Alliance](@/organizations/divine-alliance.md), a coalition led by the
[Kingdom of Poasah](@/organizations/kingdom-of-poasah.md).

# Potential Flashpoints

There was a tremendous amount of resentment against the Apgarian Confederacy in
Western Betera by the 1200s in on small part due to the Apgarian Revolutions
that saw the abolition of various monarchies that used to be in the territories
that comprise their nation at present. Their acceptance of the paganist
tradition of Old Kalassar instead of complete acceptance of Divine Masochism as
the state religion was also a great point of contention. As such, there were
many potential flashpoints in the Confederacy's 83 year existence by the time
the "conflict" began.

## Against Mehicania

Near the tail end of the Third Apgarian Revolution, a small contingent of
revolutionaries were agitating the Mehicanian peasantry to rally against the
Familia Real de la Azucena. The resultant uprising was very violent, leading to
the death of the Infanta Sofia de la Azucena among others in the royal line, but
it was ultimately crushed by royalist forces in coordination with Poasan
reinforcement.

A much larger revolution happened in 1207, led by the [Hermanos de la Libertad](@/organizations/hermanos-de-la-libertad.md)
