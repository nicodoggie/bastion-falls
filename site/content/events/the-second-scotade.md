{{ stub() }}

The second in a number of attempts to retake the lands of [Burtz](@/locations/burtz.md) from the warlords ant the [Reformists](@/religions/divine-masochism/reformist/_index.md) that have taken over since the [Fall of Bastion](@/events/fall-of-bastion.md).

The name derives from being *Followers of the Whip*, which was a turn of phrase to mean one who follows in the teachings of the [Divine Masochist](@/characters/divine-masochist.md).
