The Revolt of the Kolhan Ansa (1250-1254 AI) was a civil conflict triggered by
the death of Prince Kolha XVIII. The revolt resulted in the partition of Kolha
Ahuria and the formation of the
[Secessionist Principalities](@/organizations/secessionist-principalities.md).

# Background

Prince Kolha XVIII's death in 1250 AI created a succession crisis. His seven
children, collectively known as the Kolhan Ansa ("Kolhan Princes"), formed a
coalition opposing mainland [Ahuria's](@/locations/ahuria.md) right to appoint
the next Prince of Kolha.

# The Conflict

The Kolhan Ansa's initial action was to blockade the Mirian shore to prevent the
arrival of the mainland-appointed Kolha XIX. However, Ahurian forces, supported
by mercenaries from neighboring states, eventually broke through.

# Resolution

The conflict ended in 1254 AI with the partition of Kolha Ahuria. Five
territories separated from Kolha to form the Secessionist Principalities:

- [Sur](@/locations/sur.md)
- [Kalamba](@/locations/kalamba.md)
- [Ar](@/locations/ar.md)
- [Mir](@/locations/mir.md)
- [Sarha](@/locations/sarha.md)
