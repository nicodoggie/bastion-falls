After years garnering support, Tarsius Brigandus dissolved the Senate of the Kalassus 
and announced the foundation of the new Kalassarian Empire. In a calculated political 
move, he styled himself as Emperor Kala I, deliberately invoking the name of the 
legendary ruler [Kala](@/characters/kala.md) who had led Kalassus to prosperity 
centuries earlier (~460 PF).
