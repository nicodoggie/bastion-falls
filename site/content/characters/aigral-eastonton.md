_Sir Aigral Eastonton_ is the third son of Baron Garward Eastonton and a Paladin
of the Orthodox Church of Divine Masochism. He has distinguished himself during
his training within the Order of the Angel of Justice, and had taken his oath in
1264 at age 14, making him one of the youngest Paladins in recent memory.

# Early Life

Aigral's early childhood was spent under the tutelage of his mother, who was a
very devout follower of the Church of Divine Masochism. He was taught the
importance of duty and service to the Church and the importance of the family
from a very young age. His father, due to the increasing tensions between key
Seneran ally Poasah and the Apgarian Confederacy, was often called upon by the
Marquess of Surrey to provide logistical support in the event of a prolonged
conflict, so he was rarely home.

When he was 4, he began exhibiting signs of latent magical ability, practice of
which was considered taboo in the Church of Divine Masochism, unless tempered by
the direct guidance of the Church itself. So his mother immediately enrolled him
as a page to the Holy Knighthood of the Angel of Justice.

# Training

Due to the impending war, the nature of his training needed to be accelerated.
Sir Gareth Eastonton, Aigral's uncle and Knight Commander of the Holy
Knighthood, took on the role of his mentor. He was given special dispensation to
receive training in the use of "holy magic", which would provide a foundation to
his eventual training as a Paladin.

As magic was considered an evil in the eyes of the Church Orthodoxy, those who
perform these acts, even those within the Church itself, were required to
undergo a special penance and purification ritual. Aigral was no exception.
Along with his training, he learned this ritual of self-flagellation which he
would be required to perform in front of his uncle.

# Poasan-Apgarian Conflict

At age 7, the [Poasan-Apgarian Conflict](@/events/poasan-apgarian-conflict.md)
broke out. His father and uncle were called to arms, and Aigral acted as their
page even as they were deployed overseas in the Invasion of Sanery. Even at that
desperate time, not many children his age was sent to such a dangerous task, but
it seemed that Aigral was quite capable of handling the intense pressure and
responsibilities of working near the front lines.

While he was not a combatant at first, his healing abilities were put to good
use in the Navy men's camps. By the time he was 10, he had gained some combat
experience as they retreated from Sanerian Anasai, back to their main base in
the main Sanerian port. Their forces were routed by Apgarian reinforcements from
Estrega and Mayonne, decimating the Seneran advance force. While he and his
uncle survived due to Aigral's quick thinking and extensive use of his magic,
his father was not so lucky. Lord Garward was magically wounded with a curse
that prevented him from receiving any healing magic. Aigral's father would die
as soon as the retreat was complete.

Aigral was nearly 12 when the war ended, but he had already experienced what
most Paladins would only learn in their later years, if at all. Upon his return,
his uncle would officially name him his squire, but also recommended that the
Holy Knighthood to fast-track his training and induction into their order.

# Oath

Aigral was formally inducted into the Holy Knighthood of the Angel of Justice on
his 14th birthday, one of the youngest to ever do so. As is tradition in the
Paladinate, he was to take a personal oath to the Church and the Divine
Masochist. This Oath is to be a Paladin's guiding principle. Aigral chose the
Oath of Glory, promising to serve the Church by proudly affirming the virtues of
Divine Masochism, and spreading its ideals.

# Career

His exceptional performance was noticed by Thralmater s, then the
episcopal seneschal of the Diocese of Surrey
