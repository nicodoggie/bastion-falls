Henry Surrata-Spellvig is a naval officer in training from a cadet branch of
[House Surrata](@/families/surrata.md) from the outskirts of Cape Spellward. As
a junior member of one of Senera's most prominent noble houses, he seeks to
establish his own legacy despite being far from the main line of succession.

# Physical Appearance

Henry's mixed Seneran and Kalassarian heritage is evident in his features. His
Seneran ancestry shows in his reddish-brown hair and fair complexion, while his
Kalassarian blood manifests in his straight nose and defined jawline. Standing
at only 5'6", he is notably shorter than most of his naval peers, a source of
personal frustration that likely contributes to his ambitious nature.

Despite his small stature, he carries himself with practiced military bearing,
always standing straight-backed and rigid when in uniform. His naval attire is
meticulously maintained, from his polished brass buttons to his precisely
pressed creases, reflecting both his position and his desire to project
authority.

When not in his naval uniform, Henry favors the latest fashions popular among
Senera's young nobility. He particularly gravitates toward well-tailored
doublets in rich materials and colors that emphasize his military posture,
though these choices sometimes border on ostentatious for a cadet branch member
of his station.

# Position

Currently training as an officer in the
[Seneran Royal Navy](@/organizations/seneran-royal-navy.md), Henry represents a
cadet branch of House Surrata based near Cape Spellward. Despite his noble
lineage, his branch of the family holds relatively little influence compared to
the main line.

# Character

Ambitious and somewhat impetuous, Henry was convinced by his friends to attempt
to secure his future by approaching the dying
[Lord Marthur Malthren](@/characters/marthur-malthren.md) to be named as his
heir. While his mother's spy, serving as his aide, attempted to dissuade him
from this potentially dangerous endeavor, Henry persisted in his plans, though
he did heed the advice to hire mercenary protection for the journey.

# Relationships

Henry maintains a complex relationship with his aide, who secretly reports to
Henry's mother about his activities. While the aide attempts to guide and
protect him, Henry often dismisses these concerns in pursuit of his ambitions.
