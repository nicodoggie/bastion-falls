Dorothy Highbury was born in 1261 AI to Charlotte Highbury and a nobleman known
only as "Torch". Her mother Charlotte was originally arranged to marry a Maltrek
at age 16, but fell in love with Torch, a red-haired nobleman. Due to family
conflicts, her parents were forbidden from seeing each other, though Torch would
send Dorothy gifts, including a cherished teddy bear he made himself.

Dorothy was raised on a small estate in Highbury known as the "Little Estate",
which was given to her mother Charlotte by Dorothy's grandfather. The household
consisted of eight people: Dorothy, Charlotte, their butler Wren, governess
Dina, security guards Roland and Lyle, gardener Briggs, and maid Nyla. Charlotte
focused on raising Dorothy, and they were frequently visited by Dorothy's
grandparents who brought gifts of dresses and toys. The estate also regularly
hosted Charlotte's friends at the end of each season.

Despite her status as illegitimate, Dorothy lived a peaceful country life until
age 12, when the estate was raided by slavers who showed specific interest in
her. The raiders killed the household staff after drugging Dorothy. She later
traded these traumatic memories to the [Deep Lore](@/characters/deep-lore.md),
though she maintains hope of one day returning to pay tribute to her mother
Charlotte. The current fate of the Little Estate remains unknown.
