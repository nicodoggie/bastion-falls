{{ stub() }}

Kala was a legendary ruler of pre-imperial [Kalassus](@/locations/kalassus.md) around 460 PF, 
approximately forty years after the city's founding. While historical records from this 
period are scarce, his reign is considered a pivotal period that helped establish the 
foundations of what would later become the Kalassarian Empire.

# Legacy
The influence of Kala's rule can be seen in how his name became intrinsically linked 
with the empire itself - the term "Kalassarian" is believed to be derived from 
combining "Kala" with the suffix "-ssarian" (meaning "followers of" in ancient 
Kalassarian). His legacy was so powerful that Tarsius Brigandus, when founding the 
empire, chose to style himself as Emperor Kala I, claiming spiritual succession to the 
legendary ruler. This began a tradition of imperial legitimacy being tied to Kala's 
mythical reign.
