_Jethro Duvague_ is the current Head Cook of the
[Rozenmaiden](@/organizations/rozenmaiden.md), and was once the Grand Master of
the [La Camaraderie de la Mer](@/organizations/la-camaraderie-de-la-mer.md) and
captain of its flagship, the [Principium](@/vehicles/principium.md).

He was taken out of retirement by
[Hedwig Rosenkrantz](@/characters/hedwig-rosenkrantz.md) to become her ship's
Head Cook, not only because of his culinary skills, but also because of his
knowledge and experience as a sailor.
