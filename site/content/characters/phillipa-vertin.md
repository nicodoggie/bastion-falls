# Early Life

Phillipa Vertin is an 18-year-old Cleric known for her unique healing abilities
and her compassionate nature. Born in 1257 in Senera, she has dedicated her life
to serving her community despite facing significant health challenges. Her
experiences with near-death encounters and her connection to the Church have
shaped her journey as a healer and a devoted member of her faith.

# Health Challenges

Throughout her childhood, Philippa suffered from frequent illnesses that left
her extremely weak. Despite her health challenges, she remained determined to
assist her family and community.

# Healing Journey

In 1265, a medical mission sponsored by the Church visited her village. Her
mother, Jemima, brought Philippa to receive help for her health issues. During
this mission, a Cleric healed her, much to her mother’s joy. The Cleric revealed
that Philippa possessed a special ability to heal others and encouraged her to
use this gift. Motivated by her desire to fulfill her mother's wishes, Philippa
agreed to enter the Church and train under the Clerics.

# Physical Appearance

Philippa has long, natural wavy hair that resembles the color of fading
sunlight. She is short and small for her age, often mistaken for a child due to
her illness. Her pale yellow eyes turn vivid whenever she casts a spell. She
prefers wearing simple and humble dresses and has a birthmark under her left ear
shaped like a leaf.

# Personality

Philippa is a beautiful, soft-mannered, and kind-hearted girl with a nurturing
personality. A gentle soul, she always accepts nothing in exchange for her
healing abilities. Although she attracts many suitors, her heart belongs to the
Church, or she may simply be too naive to recognize their motives. Due to her
late education, she sometimes struggles with reading and writing, resulting in
poor handwriting.

Despite suffering from a week-long fever and chills almost every month, Philippa
learned to manage her illness after entering the Church. While her body remains
weak, she strives to fulfill her responsibilities as a devoted Cleric. During
this time, she often experiences lucid dreams of a young girl who resembles her
but is very different in many ways. She refers to this phenomenon as
“Traveling.”

# Flaws

Due to her health conditions, she is weak in terms of physical combat. She also
tends to get distracted easily from her church chores. Naive and Childish, to
the point she prefers to play with kids rather than her own peers and will put
her personal stake into and risk her own life or defy orders in order to protect
the children.
