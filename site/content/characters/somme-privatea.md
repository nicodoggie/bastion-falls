_Somme Privatea_ is a member of the
[Rozenmaiden](@/organizations/rozenmaiden.md) and is the current Grand Master of
[La Camaraderie de la Mer](@/organizations/la-camaraderie.md).

# Appearance

_Somme_ is tall but a bit skinny for his height, with a square jaw and a strong
chin. He has hazel brown eyes, and dark brown hair. He has a beard that he
maintains meticulously. He walks with a confident, purposeful stride, with his
back straight and his head held high. He tends to wear glasses while reading,
though it is unclear whether or not he is farsighted, or simply wears them as an
affectation.

# Personality

_Somme_ comes across as a bit cold and aloof, and is not particularly friendly.
An artifact of his upbringing, as he was raised by grandparents who were still
clinging to their family's aristocratic past. He is very intelligent, and is
adept at reading people, but he is also very cynical and does not trust easily.
However, once he does trust someone, he can be very loyal and devoted.
