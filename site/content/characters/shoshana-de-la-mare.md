Shoshana is the only child of Mildred De La Mare, a known whore in the Mermals.
Mildred believes in the existence of Baba Yaga and her children of the crones.
It was rumoured that not only Shoshana’s voice was offered to Baba Yaga but also
her soul in exchange for beauty and treasures. At a very young age, despite her
disability, Mildred put little Shoshana to work as a servant to various
merchants in the Narrows.

Shoshana believed that her Mother was able to communicate with Baba Yaga and
feared that one day, Baba Yaga would come for her soul. She escapes her Mother
through the help of her friends who entered the church a year ago. Sister
Philippa agreed on helping Shoshana hide in the church of Tidemark and
eventually was inducted as a Sister. Despite her disability, Shoshana is a hard
worker and always looking at things positively, a trait she acquired from her
friends. She is kind especially to her childhood friends but is known to be
anxious around strangers. She uses common sign language to communicate to
everyone and learns that she only needs to move her lips and her faith would
allow her to cast spells.

Shoshana is a young girl, with a serene beauty. She has deep yellow eyes and
long black hair that is almost the length of her height. She is the youngest,
yet the tallest amongst her friends standing taller than Breswen with a 5’2” ft.
It was rumoured that she was sired from a Lord that her Mother had seduced.

Shoshana loves reading collections of historical poems written during war times.

The midwife who helped her Mother give birth told everyone in the narrows that
Shoshana had cried when she was an infant. There are rumours that Mildred is
planning to sell Shoshana to a rich merchant. Shoshana had an awkward hairstyle
when she was a child. Shoshana’s legs and arms are full of scars from scratching
and working when she was a child but disappeared pre pubescent. At one point,
Shoshana was the shortest amongst her friends when she was around 10 yrs old.
Shoshana was always bullied by the other kids because of her disability and her
Mother being a prostitute. Shoshana is scared of witches and hags and fears that
they are out to get her soul. Shoshana’s favorite food is Shepherd's pie.
Shoshana once shared a book with Philip that she got from the trash but the book
had some of its pages torn. “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice” by Ottfried Lusatia
(which follows the story of Krabat, a young boy who was taken in by a Master
Sorcerer who is learning black magic. Each year he forces one of his apprentices
to battle him in a life and death duel which the Master always wins and the
Apprentice dies. Krabat fell in love with a flower gatherer young girl and had
learned that Love is stronger than any spell.)
