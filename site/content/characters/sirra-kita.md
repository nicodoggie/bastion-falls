Sirra Kita is the eldest daughter of Duke of Trade, Coro Kita of Calamutz, Ever the obedient daughter, she had performed all the requirements of her noble birth. However, her stressful upbringing had led her to find release in the secret sex dens in the Calamutian dredges.

She spent years disguising herself in various ways during her romps, until she was finally discovered. Her father did confront her, but did not really sanction her. Instead, he confessed that he was impressed that she was able to dodge their guards, and keep herself under the radar even after they were actively trying to figure out what she was doing every night. So he gave her an opportunity to free herself from the proprieties of Calamutian nobility. If she can collect information about some of the members of court that he did not know, he would hire her as a spy. She would succeed the challenge.

She would be sent to Poasah to join the military as a member of the Northeast Garrison at Fort Mountain-Foot to find the source of slaves being sneaked into Calamutz and surrounding areas..
