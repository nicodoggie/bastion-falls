_Angelita "Angel" Rannek_ is a young noble born in 1264 AI to the House of
Rannek, one of the prominent noble houses of Senera. As the youngest daughter of
Marquess Rannek and Marchioness Maria of Rannek, she currently resides at Castle
Rannekford. Unbeknownst to her, her angelic transformation is due to her nature
as an Aasimar.

## Early Life

Angel's birth was preceded by supernatural occurrences, when her mother, the
Marchioness Maria, experienced a prophetic dream of a child with soft wings and
an angelic face in her garden. Despite concerns about the Marchioness's advanced
age, multiple clerics and physicians confirmed the pregnancy, which proceeded
without complications.

## Education and Upbringing

Growing up at Castle Rannekford, Angel's childhood was marked by relative
solitude, as her siblings were preoccupied with marriage prospects and skill
development. Her education took a significant turn when her parents hired a
skilled sorcerer as her tutor, introducing her to the art of spellcasting, which
became a source of great enjoyment for her.

## Physical Appearance

Angel is described as exceedingly beautiful with an angelic countenance,
befitting her Aasimar heritage. Standing at 4'0" with a slight build, she is
known for typically wearing her wavy long hair in a crown braid style. Her
mother describes her eyes as Cognac-colored, and her hair as of a tint of ecru.

## Personality

A defining characteristic of Angel's personality is her desire to bring
happiness to others, enhanced by her unique ability to perceive people's auras,
which she notes glow when they experience joy. She has a particular fondness for
sweets, especially desserts prepared with sweetened milk.
