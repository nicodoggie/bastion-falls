_Lilya Bkorneblume_ is an 18-year-old member of the Royal Seneran Navy, known
for her mysterious abilities and exceptional combat skills. Adopted by the
Surrata Family, she struggles with her past and often feels out of place within
her noble upbringing. Despite her challenges, she has proven herself as a
formidable fighter, rising through the ranks of the Navy.

## Early Life

Lilya is an 18-year-old girl with mysterious abilities that she dares not
discuss with her family or friends. Adopted by the Surrata Family, she did not
exhibit any remarkable traits after a year. With no memories of her past and
little interest in taking her adopted familyâ€™s name, she often fades into the
background.

The Surrata Family intended to mold her into a fine noblewoman to marry off and
strengthen family ties. However, after months of showing no interest, they
decided it was better to send her to the Royal Navy.

## Personality

Lilya can come off as emotionless due to her difficulty in expressing her
feelings, stemming from her inability to remember her past. The only time she
shows emotions is around animals like horses, dogs, cats, or cows. She tends to
remember their names but struggles to do so with her peers. Quiet and slightly
withdrawn, she finds peace in solitude and prefers to accomplish tasks alone.
Lilya becomes vocal and hostile toward those who do not tell the truth. Despite
her rebellious streak, she possesses a good heart, which helps her function in
society.

Lilya sometimes suffers from feverish dreams about a young girl who has the same
face as her but acts very differently. She often forgets these dreams upon
waking.

## Military Career

Her lack of interest and motivation briefly disappeared when she entered the
Navy due to the demands and responsibilities she must adhere to. Her rise in the
ranks was doubted and challenged by others but was eventually accepted due to
her combat prowess. She became one of the youngest to achieve a rank in the
Navy. Even with her hands restrained or blindfolded, she is a deadly fighter.

## Physical Appearance

Lilya has a beautiful, almost innocent face and long, flowing hair that
captivates those around her. These qualities were the reason the Surrata Family
adopted her. She has pale yellow eyes that brighten whenever she is in combat.
Although she is short and small in stature, she sports a lean body due to her
training in the Navy.

## Flaws

Lilya suffers from amnesia, leading her friends and family to believe she has
short-term memory issues. Her indifference can sometimes manifest as a lack of
action or urgency regarding the needs of others.
