_Martinella Shandling_, or more infamously _Martina_, is the proprietress of
_[The Balsawood Boad](@/locations/the-narrows.md#the-balsawood-boat)_, and one
of the councilmembers of the Smugglers' Guild in

and her partnership with

all competition in the prostitution business in the Murmals district.
