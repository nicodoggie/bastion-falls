Marthur Malthren is the current Lord of Malthren and holder of a Baronetcy in
[The Narrows](@/locations/the-narrows.md). Born in 1196 AI, he represents the
final generation of one of Surrey's oldest noble houses, which traces its
lineage back to the pre-Kalassarian Magarisok Hick tribe.

# Appearance

Lord Malthren cuts a striking if somewhat unsettling figure. His Hick ancestry
is evident in his sharp, angular features: high cheekbones, a prominent nose,
and deep-set eyes of pale green. Years of seclusion have left him with an
unhealthy pallor, his already gaunt face appearing almost skull-like with sunken
cheeks and dark circles beneath his eyes.

His silver-white hair falls past his shoulders in loose waves, often adorned
with wooden beads and small bonesâ€”remnants of old Hick traditions. Despite his
noble status, he eschews the typical finery of his station, preferring simple,
earth-toned robes made of undyed wool and linen. His clothing often features
intricate embroidery of natural motifs: twisting vines, leaves, and the phases
of the moon worked in muted threads.

He moves with a deliberate slowness that some mistake for frailty, though his
tall frame remains straight and unbowed despite his advanced age. Around his
neck, he wears a collection of pouches containing herbs and various natural
curios, adding to his mystical appearance.

# Position and Holdings

Lord Malthren's holdings include Malthren Manor and its surrounding environs. As
Baron, he has the right to:

- Designate areas in his holdings as township and harbor
- Maintain local roads and infrastructure
- Appoint the Reeve of the Narrows
- Appoint the Harbor Master

# Character

Lord Malthren has notably refused multiple marriage proposals from wealthy
merchants seeking noble titles, contributing to House Malthren's impending
extinction. It is not known why he continually refuses these proposals, but he
is seen as surly and aloof. He wishes to be a recluse, even keeping himself from
his house servants.

# Residence

He resides in Malthren Manor, an ancient structure that preserves much of its
pre-Kalassarian architecture, featuring:

- Fragrant hardwood construction using Keelswood timber
- Multiple gardens and orchards
- A small staff of servants
- Twisted wrought iron fences covered in ivy
- A distinctive entrance with a horned beast mask mounted above the gates

The manor's state reflects both the family's ancient prestige and current
decline, remaining mostly empty with only a handful of servants maintaining the
grounds.
