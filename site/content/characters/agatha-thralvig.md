_Sister Agatha Thralvig_ serves as the Temple Representative on Tidemark's city
council. Though commonly addressed as "Sister," she never completed her formal
training with the Sisters of the Angel of Justice, instead finding her calling
in public service and lay ministry.

## Family Background

The Thralvig family has deep roots in the Keelswood forests of
Surrey-on-the-Brams. Folk history mentions that the family had descended from
Hick druids who once tended the ancient forest, and had driven off Kalassarian
incursions ihto its deepest parts. Though most modern Thralvigs have adapted to
urban life, they maintain strong connections to the forest's traditions and
management. This heritage influences Agatha's approach to both religious and
civic duties, blending practical administration with respect for traditional
wisdom.

## Early Life & Religious Training

Born to a family of traditional forest administrators, Agatha began her
religious training at age 12 with the Sisters of the Angel of Justice. Her early
years were split between religious studies and learning the ancient
forest-keeping traditions from her family. However, by age 16, she felt called
to a different path, leaving formal religious training to pursue direct
community service while maintaining her family's connection to the Keelswood.

### Mill Quarter Apprenticeship (1252-1260)

After departing from the Sisters, Agatha began an apprenticeship under her
uncle, Henrik Thralvig, the Mill Quarter Administrator. During these formative
years, she learned:

- Traditional sustainable forestry practices
- Modern industrial management
- Worker relations and safety protocols
- Supply chain logistics
- Community outreach strategies

### Spiritual Evolution

During her apprenticeship, Agatha's religious focus shifted from the veneration
of the Angel of Justice to the Angel of Nature, finding deeper spiritual meaning
in the forest-keeping traditions of her ancestors. This transition helped her
bridge the gap between:

- Ancient Hick forest wisdom
- Modern Divine Masochist theology
- Industrial development needs
- Environmental stewardship
- Community welfare

This unique spiritual perspective would later influence her approach to both
religious leadership and social reform, particularly in the Narrows Initiative
and her work with the Mill Quarter's workforce development programs.

## Physical Appearance

Sister Agatha embodies the understated beauty common to the old Keelswood
families. Her sea-glass eyes, shifting between green and blue in different
lights, carry the direct, evaluating gaze of her forest-keeping ancestors. A
scatter of light freckles crosses her fair complexion, testament to time spent
on forest paths rather than temple halls. Her auburn hair, usually secured with
simple wooden pins, frames a strong, squared jawline characteristic of the
Thralvig lineage.

Unlike the formal, restrictive robes favored by most temple representatives,
Agatha opts for the flowing, practical garments typical of Nature's adherents.
Her attire - loose-fitting tunics and wrapped skirts in earth tones - allows for
easy movement through both council chambers and forest shrines. While more
revealing than traditional temple dress, her clothing maintains a dignified
modesty that stands in marked contrast to the deliberately sensual garments of
Delight's followers. Her only concession to office is the temple medallion worn
at her throat.

She moves with a natural grace born of physical work rather than studied
refinement. Her capable hands, marked equally by administrative duties and
forest craft, gesture with deliberate purpose when she speaks. Her voice carries
both authority and earthiness, comfortable in both giving council orders and
teaching ancient forest wisdom. Standing at moderate height, she maintains the
straight posture of one who has carried both literal and metaphorical burdens
with equal strength.

Sister Agatha makes no effort to enhance her natural features, letting her work
speak louder than any artificial embellishments. This unadorned presentation,
from her practical leather boots to her clean but unpolished fingernails,
reflects her dedication to substance over appearance - a philosophy that guides
both her religious practice and her public service.
