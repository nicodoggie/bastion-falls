# Origin

## Concept

- Magic is new, about 10 years since it's been unlocked
- The thing that made magic is slowly eating the cosmos, also people are
  attempting to either gain more power, or stop/seal the magical origin to save
  the world

## What is the Magical Origin?

- It is a growing mass of what seems to be a "void"
- In the very center is an alchemical symbol that represents the world,
  surrounded by transmutation formulae to transmute the world to the past.

## What are implications of the "Magic" Origin?

- It is growing at a rate of 1km per year
- At this point, it's been growing for about 50 years already
- The origin is believed to be beneath the Cathedral of a major religion of the
  world, which people start believing/seeing as a sure sign of the apocalypse.
- People begin to migrate as far away from the origin as possible
- People are born with various abilities of magical strength and varieties
- Some are born with various physical deformities
- Storms occasionally spawn from the origin, when storms pass, strange
  occurrences happen. Sometimes entire towns disappear, get displaced, or are
  replaced by some strange town form.
- Refugees are treated differently in different towns
- Some countries are taking advantage of this situation by directing refugees
  toward rival factions/nations, sometimes with agents that may sow discord.
- A new religion formed based on worship of the magical origin. There are a
  couple of designated "prophets". The prophet is a woman who had entered the
  origin, transformed into an "angel"

## Where we begin

- A small village, ~1000 miles away from the origin suddenly disappears and is
  replaced by an entirely different village of what seem to be survivors of one
  of the storms.
