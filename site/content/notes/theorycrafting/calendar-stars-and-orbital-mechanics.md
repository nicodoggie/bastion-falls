## Overview

Thera's orbital mechanics display an unnaturally perfect regularity that sets it
apart from other planets in its system. This artificial precision suggests
possible intervention by an unknown entity or entities.

## Orbital Characteristics

### Solar Orbit

- Perfect circular orbit (unique among system's planets)
- Exactly 360 days per solar year
- Fixed 23.5° axial tilt (no variation)
- Stable seasonal patterns
- Precise day/night cycles

### Lunar Mechanics

- Single satellite with perfect 30-day orbit
- Exact synchronization with solar year
- Precise tidal influences
- Regular phases
- No orbital eccentricity

## Calendar Implications

### Mathematical Precision

- 12 months of exactly 30 days
- No need for leap year corrections
- Perfect alignment of lunar/solar cycles
- Simplified astronomical calculations
- Reliable navigation tables

### Cultural Impact

- Early development of accurate calendars
- Precise agricultural timing
- Reliable maritime navigation
- Accurate tide prediction
- Stable seasonal ceremonies

## Theoretical Implications

### Planar Theory Connection

## Major Cycle Components

### Primary Cycles

1. Feywild Synchronization

   - 30,000 year primary cycle
   - Last major convergence: ~10,000 PF (Great Fey Crossing)
   - Facilitated migration of [Kurerans](@/species/kureran.md) and other fey
     species
   - Strongest influence on natural magical patterns

2. Far Realms Connection

   - ~29,800 year cycle (slightly offset from Feywild)
   - Creates interference patterns with Feywild cycle
   - Discovered around 8000-7000 PF
   - Significant impact on magical stability

3. Ideal Planes Intersection
   - Five distinct subcycles
   - Complex harmonics affect magical accessibility
   - Contribute to regional variations in magical strength

## Navigation Applications

### Maritime Benefits

- Precise stellar navigation
- Accurate tide tables
- Reliable weather prediction
- Consistent seasonal patterns
- Perfect monthly cycles

### Historical Impact

## The Solar System

Unlike its neighboring planets with their eccentric orbits, Thera's perfect
circular path remains one of the great mysteries of astronomical study.

### Inner Planets

- Cruyme: Highly elliptical orbit, extreme temperature variations
- Nevus: Unstable orbital period, significant axial wobble
- Thera: Perfect circular orbit, precise seasons (origin unknown)

### Outer Planets

- Rams: Notable orbital eccentricity, seasonal extremes
- Rejupit: Complex orbital resonances with other planets
- Surtan: Ring system affects orbital mechanics
- Suran: Tilted orbital plane (mythologically linked to Surtan)
- Pentune: Long, elliptical orbit

### The Twin Giants: Surtan and Suran

Ancient Seneran astronomers viewed these planets as cosmic twins, their rings
and tilted orbits suggesting an eternal celestial dance. This mythology
persisted across multiple cultures, though interpretations varied:

1. Pre-Kalassarian Interpretation
   - Reference to maritime traditions from:

## Research Questions

1. Artificial Origin

   - Who or what engineered this system?
   - When was it established?
   - What was the purpose?
   - How is it maintained?

2. Planar Connections

   - Relationship to planar cycles
   - Impact on magical accessibility
   - Connection to Feywild synchronization
   - Influence on planar boundaries

3. Future Implications
   - Long-term stability
   - Potential changes
   - Impact on magical systems
   - Navigation reliability

## Stellar Navigation

### Major Constellations

The night sky of Thera features 83 recognized constellations, with these being
the most significant for navigation:

#### Divine Constellations

- The Crown of Minerva (circumpolar, contains Navigator's Eye)
- Justicia's Scales (seasonal indicator)
- Pomona's Grove (agricultural marker)
- Volupta's Dance (summer constellation)
- Amarina's Veil (winter harbinger)

#### Mythical Beasts

- The Great Tarrasque (spans four seasons)
- The Dragon's Flight (spring to summer transition)
- The Catoblepas (autumn marker)
- The Sleeping Wyrm (winter constellation)
- The Phoenix Rising (spring herald)

#### Natural Forms

- The Great Whale (maritime navigation)
- The Swift Deer (seasonal migration marker)
- The Hunting Wolf (winter guide)
- The Diving Osprey (summer sailing guide)
- The Swimming Seal (tidal indicator)

### The Navigator's Eye

Unlike Earth's Polaris, Thera's pole star (known as the Navigator's Eye) sits
perfectly aligned with the planet's axis of rotation, appearing completely
stationary. It forms the central jewel in the Crown of Minerva constellation,
its unwavering position reflecting Thera's perfect orbital mechanics.

Characteristics:

- Perfect polar alignment
- Consistent brightness
- No apparent movement
- Visible from both hemispheres
- Used for precise navigation

### The Perfect Zodiac

Thera's zodiac consists of 12 constellations perfectly aligned with the months,
each occupying exactly 30° of the ecliptic. This unnaturally precise arrangement
further suggests artificial intervention in Thera's astronomical system.
