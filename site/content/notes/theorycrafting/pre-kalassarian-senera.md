## Overview

This document explores potential connections between pre-Kalassarian Seneran
culture and fey influences, particularly focusing on druidic traditions and
possible elven contact.

## Key Theories

### Elven Refugee Theory

- Some elven refugees from the Feywild may have settled in present-day Senera
- Attracted by similar natural practices and maritime focus
- Could explain sophisticated early navigation and forestry techniques
- No concrete physical evidence has survived
- Possible deliberate concealment of their presence

### Druidic Traditions

1. Maritime Focus

   - Sophisticated tide-reading
   - Advanced navigation techniques
   - Weather prediction
   - Complex seasonal calculations
   - River channel knowledge

2. Forest Stewardship

   - Sacred grove maintenance
   - Sustainable harvesting practices
   - Tree-shaping techniques
   - Natural defenses
   - Seasonal observances

3. Astronomical Knowledge
   - Tide-star correlations
   - Navigation by stars
   - Seasonal markers
   - Eclipse prediction
   - Weather forecasting

## Evidence Patterns

### Physical Evidence

## The Hicks (Pre-Kalassarian Senerans)

### Etymology & Meta Context

- Play on "Picts" (painted people)
- Maintains the hard consonant sound
- Simple, memorable name
- Suggests "rustic" or "provincial" to modern readers
- Could have interesting in-world etymology development

### Cultural Parallels

Like the Picts:

- Pre-imperial native culture

- Druidic influences
- Complex relationship with invaders

### Historical Development

1. Early Hick Period (Prehistoric/Bronze Age)

   - Connected to early Manasculan seafaring culture

2. Middle Hick Period (Phoenician/Elven contact)

   - Advanced maritime knowledge
   - Foreign trade influences
   - Possible elven contact
   - Cultural sophistication

3. Late Hick Period (Pre-Kalassarian)
   - Peak maritime culture
   - Advanced druidic practices
   - Established trade networks
   - Complex society

### Cultural Distinctions

Unlike the Picts:
