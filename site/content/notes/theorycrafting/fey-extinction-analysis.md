## Overview

The Silent Ages (435-1225 AI) saw the extinction of most fey species in Thera, with
the notable exception of the [Dolo-Dolo](@/species/dolo-dolo.md). This mass
extinction event provides crucial insights into both magical biology and the nature
of planar connections.

## Physiological Dependency

### Magical Requirements

1. Baseline Needs
   - Constant magical energy absorption
   - Connection to Feywild patterns
   - Specific magical frequencies
   - Minimum threshold for survival

2. Adaptation Limitations
   - Unable to process raw Theran magic efficiently
   - Required *Ritma* or enhancer orb assistance
   - Limited evolutionary timeframe
   - Biological constraints

### Extinction Mechanism

```
class FeyViability:
  def calculate_survival_chance(self, population, conditions):
    """
    Model fey population viability
    """
    base_magic = conditions.ambient_magic
    orb_support = conditions.enhancer_proximity
    human_pressure = conditions.conflict_level
    
    threshold = self.MINIMUM_MAGICAL_REQUIREMENT
    current_level = (base_magic * orb_support) - human_pressure
    
    return {
        'viable': current_level > threshold,
        'decline_rate': threshold - current_level,
        'estimated_survival_time': self.project_survival(current_level)
    }
```

## Extinction Pattern Analysis

### Primary Causes

1. Magical Energy Starvation
   - Primary cause of population decline
   - Accelerated by distance from enhancer orbs
   - Systemic failure of biological processes
   - No viable adaptation mechanism

2. Human Aggression
   - Kalassarian genocide of [Kurerans](@/species/kureran.md)
   - Ahurian campaigns against Dolo-Dolo
   - Competition for orb-proximate territories
   - Disruption of survival strategies

### Timeline of Decline

1. Early Phase (435-500 AI)
   - Initial weakening of magical access
   - Beginning of population stress
   - First local extinctions
   - Migration to orb-proximate areas

2. Critical Phase (500-600 AI)
   - Mass die-offs in low-magic areas
   - Increased competition for resources
   - Accelerated decline
   - Formation of refugee populations

3. Terminal Phase (600-700 AI)
   - Most populations extinct
   - Remaining groups isolated
   - Limited to orb-proximate refugia
   - Final extinction events

## Dolo-Dolo Survival Case Study

### Success Factors

1. Geographical
   - Proximity to major enhancer orb deposits
   - Defensible mountain territory
   - Natural barriers to human expansion
   - Stable magical microclimate

2. Biological
   - Possible adaptations to Theran magic
   - More resilient physiology
   - Successful population maintenance
   - Effective resource management

3. Cultural
   - Preservation of magical knowledge
   - Adaptive survival strategies
   - Community cohesion
   - Resistance to external pressures

## Implications for Modern Era

### Conservation Theory

1. Magical Species Management
   - Critical enhancer orb proximity
   - Population viability thresholds
   - Habitat requirements
   - Protection strategies

2. Restoration Possibilities
   - Post-Bastion conditions
   - New magical frameworks
   - Population reintroduction
   - Habitat reconstruction

### Research Applications

1. Biological Studies
   - Magical dependency mechanisms
   - Adaptation potential
   - Survival thresholds
   - Population dynamics

2. Conservation Planning
   - Critical habitat identification
   - Population viability analysis
   - Resource management
   - Protection protocols

## Modern Fey Population Status

### Surviving Populations

1. Dolo-Dolo
   - Current population status
   - Adaptation success
   - Cultural preservation
   - Future prospects

2. Potential Other Survivors
   - Unconfirmed populations
   - Possible refugia
   - Post-Bastion emergence
   - Research needs

### Post-Bastion Implications

1. Recovery Potential
   - Changed magical conditions
   - Habitat availability
   - Population viability
   - Conservation needs

2. Future Challenges
   - Magical stability
   - Human relations
   - Resource competition
   - Habitat protection
