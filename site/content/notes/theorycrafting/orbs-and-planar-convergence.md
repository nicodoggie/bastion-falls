## Natural Formation

### Crystallization Theory

- Orbs represent crystallized planar intersections
- Form at points of stable planar convergence
- Natural process not fully understood
- Size correlates with convergence strength

### Formation Conditions

1. Major Convergence Points
   - Large, perfectly spherical orbs
   - Mark significant planar intersections
   - Possibly artificial enhancement
   - Stable long-term formations

2. Natural Deposits
   - Smaller, irregular orbs
   - Form in cave systems
   - Cluster around major orbs
   - Natural formation process

## Orb Classifications

### Enhancement/Repulsion Pair

1. [Orbs of Enhancement](@/misc/orbs-of-power/orb-of-enhancement.md)
   - Purple-black coloration
   - Channel energy from Chaotic Planes to Material
   - Most common in natural deposits
   - Critical for magical creature survival

2. [Orbs of Repulsion](@/misc/orbs-of-power/orb-of-repulsion.md)
   - Black with red light
   - Push energy from Material to other planes
   - 1:100 ratio with enhancers
   - Create anti-magic fields

### Artificial Pair

1. [Orbs of Endowment](@/misc/orbs-of-power/orb-of-endowment.md)
   - Pearlescent white
   - Grant magical access
   - [Reformed Church](@/religion/reformed-church-of-the-divine-masochist.md) creation
   - Portable magical sources

2. [Orbs of Absorption](@/misc/orbs-of-power/orb-of-absorption.md)
   - Uniform yellow light
   - Drain and redistribute magical energy
   - Affect mental attributes
   - Artificial origin

## Geographical Distribution

### Natural Patterns

1. Major Deposits
   - [Stairway to the Heavens](@/locations/stairway-to-the-heavens.md)
   - Sorha region of [Ahuria](@/locations/ahuria.md)
   - Mountain cave systems
   - Ancient planar convergence points

2. [Bastion](@/locations/bastion.md) Phenomenon
   - Massive enhancement orb
   - Possible artificial enhancement
   - Connected to magic's return
   - Unique formation conditions

### Mathematical Model

```
class OrbFormation:
    def calculate_formation_potential(self, location, time):
        """
        Model orb formation likelihood
        """
        return {
            'planar_convergence': self.convergence_strength(location, time),
            'geological_factors': self.cave_system_viability(location),
            'existing_orb_influence': self.nearby_orb_effects(location),
            'formation_type': self.predict_orb_type(location)
        }

    def predict_enhancement_repulsion_ratio(self, location):
        """
        Calculate expected ratio of enhancement to repulsion orbs
        """
        base_ratio = 100  # Standard 100:1 ratio
        modifiers = self.local_planar_conditions(location)
        return base_ratio * modifiers.influence_factor
```

## Artificial Creation

### Reformed Church Methods

1. Pedestal Technology
   - Unknown creation process
   - Forms orbs over time
   - Portable formation points
   - Limited to endowment/absorption types

2. Theoretical Implications
   - Controlled planar manipulation
   - Post-Bastion understanding
   - New magical framework
   - Possible historical knowledge

## Research Applications

### Current Studies

1. Formation Mechanics
   - Natural process investigation
   - Artificial creation analysis
   - Planar interaction mapping
   - Energy flow patterns

2. Distribution Analysis
   - Geographical patterns
   - Formation conditions
   - Historical significance
   - Future predictions

### Practical Applications

1. Magical Infrastructure
   - Enhancement orb placement
   - Repulsion orb barriers
   - Energy distribution networks
   - Population support

2. Conservation
   - Magical creature habitats
   - Energy stability
   - Resource management
   - Protection protocols

## Modern Implications

### Post-Bastion Era

1. Changed Conditions
   - New formation patterns
   - Different planar alignments
   - Artificial influence
   - Future uncertainty

2. Research Priorities
   - Formation prediction
   - Distribution mapping
   - Effect monitoring
   - Application development

### Future Considerations

1. Natural Formations
   - New deposit prediction
   - Stability assessment
   - Protection needs
   - Access management

2. Artificial Development
   - Creation technology
   - Control methods
   - Safety protocols
   - Ethical considerations
