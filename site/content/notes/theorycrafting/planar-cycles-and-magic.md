## Major Cycle Components

### Primary Cycles

1. Feywild Synchronization

   - 30,000 year primary cycle
   - Last major convergence: ~10,000 PF (Great Fey Crossing)
   - Facilitated migration of [Kurerans](@/species/kureran.md) and other fey
     species
   - Strongest influence on natural magical patterns

2. Far Realms Connection

   - ~29,800 year cycle (slightly offset from Feywild)
   - Creates interference patterns with Feywild cycle
   - Discovered around 8000-7000 PF
   - Significant impact on magical stability

3. Ideal Planes Intersection
   - Five distinct subcycles
   - Complex harmonics affect magical accessibility
   - Contribute to regional variations in magical strength

## Mathematical Model

Total magical potential M(t) at time t can be expressed as:

```
def magical_potential(t):
    """
    Calculate magical potential at time t
    """
    return {
        'feywild': k1 * sin(2*pi*t/30000),
        'far_realms': k2 * sin(2*pi*t/29800),
        'ideal_planes': [
            k3[i] * sin(2*pi*t/period[i])
            for i in range(5)
        ]
    }

# Ideal Plane periods (in years)
periods = [1200, 500, 100, 25, 7]
```

## Cycle Interactions

### Short-Term Fluctuations

1. Seasonal Variations (7-year cycle)

   - Affects day-to-day magical accessibility
   - Influences ritual timing
   - Most predictable cycle

2. Generational Changes (100-year cycle)
   - Impacts magical learning and adaptation
   - Affects institutional knowledge transfer
   - Contributed to _Ritma_ evolution

### Medium-Term Patterns

1. Century-Scale Fluctuations (500-year cycle)

   - Influences cultural magical traditions
   - Affects empire-scale magical infrastructure
   - May explain some historical transitions

2. Millennial Cycle (1200-year cycle)
   - Major impact on civilizational development
   - Possibly related to Silent Ages duration
   - Influences large-scale magical phenomena

## Historical Evidence

### Great Fey Crossing (c. 10,000 PF)

- Peak Feywild-Thera synchronization
- Multiple Ideal Planes alignment
- Enabled mass migration from Feywild
- Established conditions for _Ritma_ development

### Silent Ages (435-1225 AI)

- Misalignment of multiple cycles
- Gradual shift in planar relationships
- Regional variations in decline
- Complex interaction with [Orbs of Power](@/misc/orbs-of-power/_index.md)

### Fall of Bastion (1225 AI)

- New pattern of planar alignment
- Multiple cycle convergence
- Return of magical accessibility
- Different conditions from pre-Silent Ages

## Current Era Analysis

### Present Conditions

- Multiple planes approaching intersection
- New patterns of magical accessibility
- Different from both pre-Silent and Silent Ages
- Requires new theoretical frameworks

### Future Projections

- Approaching significant Far Realms convergence
- Multiple Ideal Planes intersecting
- Potential for unprecedented magical conditions
- May require adaptation of current practices

## Research Implications

1. Magical Infrastructure

   - Design must account for cycle variations
   - Need for adaptive systems
   - Importance of [Orbs of Power](@/misc/orbs-of-power/_index.md)
   - Regional considerations

2. Theoretical Understanding
   - Integration of historical knowledge
   - Modern cycle observation
   - Prediction models
   - Adaptation strategies
