## Original Development

The Kurerans developed _Ritma_ as a methodology to translate Feywild magical
understanding to Theran energies. As Feywild natives, they needed a complex but
precise system based on their deep magical knowledge - similar to learning a
second language through academic study.

The development period (10,000 PF - 3,000 PF) involved extensive study of
Thera's "raw chaotic energies," which differed significantly from the Feywild's
natural magical patterns. This research culminated in the founding of
[Korad](@/locations/korad.md), marking their mastery of the system.

## Kalassarian Adoption

As Thera natives, Kalassarians had natural affinity for local magical patterns.
_Ritma_ gave them the framework to access their innate potential, achieving
greater raw power despite less sophisticated understanding - like native
speakers learning formal grammar of their mother tongue.

## Mathematical Expression

For a magic user attempting to access Theran magical potential T(t):

Effective Power = T(t) × A(o) × R(p) Where:

- T(t) = Raw magical potential at time t
- A(o) = Origin affinity (higher for Theran natives)
- R(p) = _Ritma_ proficiency

Typical comparative values:

# Simplified representation

```
Kureran = {
    'origin_affinity': 0.6,  # Feywild native
    'ritma_proficiency': 1.0  # Original developers
}

Kalassarian = {
    'origin_affinity': 1.0,  # Theran native
    'ritma_proficiency': 0.8  # Learned system
}
```

## Planar Alignment Dependency

The effectiveness of _Ritma_ techniques was intrinsically tied to specific
planar alignment conditions. Classical _Ritma_ effectiveness R(t) during time t:

R(t) = Σ(pᵢ × aᵢ(t)) Where:

- pᵢ = planar influence coefficient
- aᵢ(t) = alignment factor for plane i at time t

## The Silent Ages Decline

The gradual obsolescence of _Ritma_ during the Silent Ages (435-1225 AI) can be
understood as a misalignment between the original framework and shifting planar
conditions. Like using astronomical tables that become outdated, the knowledge
was preserved but no longer applicable to current conditions.

### Regional Variations

- Areas with different planar influences experienced varying rates of decline
- Some regions maintained partial effectiveness longer
- Remote areas might have developed local modifications
- Proximity to [Orbs of Enhancement](@/misc/orbs-of-power/orb-of-enhancement.md)
  could stabilize local conditions

## Modern Implications

The return of magic following the [Fall of Bastion](@/events/fall-of-bastion.md)
(1225 AI) doesn't represent a return to original conditions. New planar
alignments require new frameworks, though understanding of classical _Ritma_
remains valuable for theoretical purposes.

Current magical practices likely represent a hybrid approach:

- Adaptation of classical _Ritma_ principles
- New techniques developed for current planar conditions
- Integration of knowledge gained during the Silent Ages
- Understanding gained from studying

## Research Questions

1. How do modern planar alignments differ from those during _Ritma_'s
   development?
2. Can classical _Ritma_ techniques be modified for current conditions?
3. What role do [Orbs of Power](@/misc/orbs-of-power/_index.md) play in
   stabilizing magical access?
4. How do regional variations in magical effectiveness relate to historical
   planar alignments?
