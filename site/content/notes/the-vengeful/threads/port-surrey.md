# Events

## Execution of the Crew of the Principium

- scheduled to be executed on 1275-09-15
- the crew is currently in [The Splits](/../../../locations/admiraltys-helm.md)
- the Governor of Sanery is representing the Apgarian Confederacy in the Treaty
  of Turain Organization meeting currently underway in the Admiralty's Helm.
  This is strange for two reasons:
  - the Apgarian government had not cared about the fate of the Principium
      until now.
  - A governor of a province is not usually chosen to attend a meeting of
    this sort.
    - Usually members of the Apgarian Diplomatic Corps attend such meetings.
    - This person being the governor of Sanery suggests that this may be a
      Reformist ploy to gain an advantage over the Hags of Hama and La
      Camaraderie.
- Edmar Pritchett, a Seneran diplomat that attempted to investigate Raibon
  Island recently, reported a number of concerns to the Treaty of Turain
  Organization, including:
  - The Hags of Hama, and their willingness to host a TOTO delegation
  - Actions of the Reformists in the island
  - Potential Mehicanian involvement with the Free Theater
  - Paula Abdul's involvement in the death of Helene Nise
