# Events

## Execution of the Crew of the Principium

- scheduled to be executed on 1275-09-15
- the crew is currently in [The Splits](/../../../locations/admiraltys-helm.md)
- the Governor of Sanery is representing the Apgarian Confederacy in the Treaty
  of Turain Organization meeting currently underway in the Admiralty's Helm.
  This is strange for two reasons:
  - the Apgarian government had not cared about the fate of the Principium until
    now.
  - A governor of a province is not usually chosen to attend a meeting of this
    sort.
    - Usually members of the Apgarian Diplomatic Corps attend such meetings.
    - This person being the governor of Sanery suggests that this may be a
      Reformist ploy to gain an advantage over the Hags of Hama and La
      Camaraderie.
- Edmar Pritchett, a Seneran diplomat that attempted to investigate Raibon
  Island recently, reported a number of concerns to the Treaty of Turain
  Organization, including:
  - The Hags of Hama, and their willingness to host a TOTO delegation
  - Actions of the Reformists in the island
  - Potential Mehicanian involvement with the Free Theater
  - Paula Abdul's involvement in the death of Helene Nise

## Treaty of Turain Organization Meeting

- A Special Meeting of the ToTO was called by the Seneran State invoked under
  Article X Section 2.4 of the Treaty of Turain Organization.
  - Who:
    - Peregrin Moorcock, Chief Ambassador of the Royal Seneran Diplomatic Corps
    - Edmar Pritchett, member of the Royal Seneran Diplomatic Corps
  - What: Senera wishes to raise the following issues:
    1. The recent magical re-emergence of the Town of Hama,
    2. The rise of the Hags of Hama and their alleged connection with known and
      suspected pirate groups in and around the area.
    3. Apgarian military funding of La Camaraderie, which may be tantamount to
      violations of
      [Article IX](../../../world-novelty/treaty-of-turain.md#article-ix).
    4. If issue 3 proves true, then the Apgarian Confederacy may be in violation
       of [Article XI](../../../world-novelty/treaty-of-turain.md#article-xi) of
       the Treaty as well. As agents of the Apgarian state, La Camaraderie has
       been undermining Senera's role as _Arbiter of the Seas_ by performing
       operations that led to the sinking of many Seneran patrols in the
       Sarmatian Sea.
    5. In order to address the issues Senera wishes to:
       1. deploy a special multinational force in order to investigate violations
          to Maritime Law as performed by this new group.
       2. if any of the accusations prove true, a multinational group consisting
          of Mehicanian, Seneran and Poasan agents, observed by Apgarian forces,
  - The Mehicanian delegation wishes to reiterate a report that former members
    of the Illustrados was operating in the area. They similarly made a request
    prior to this meeting to investigate. This may be the perfect opportunity
    for them as well.
  - The Poasan delegation has no immediate concerns, but wish to take part in
    the delegation sent to the Town of Hama. They cannot commit troops however,
    as troops are currently focused on retaking its Northeastern corridor.
  - the Apgarian delegation would like to respond thusly:
    - They would like to reiterate that La Camaraderie de la Mer is definitely
      _not_ affiliated with the Apgarian government. In fact, they would like to
      take advantage of this request by the Seneran government to take action
      against La Camaraderie de la Mer themselves as a part of a joint military
      response.
    - Many members of La Camaraderie, including those of the Principium, are
      however, citizens of Apgar, and must be tried and incarcerated in Apgarian
      facilities.
    - They request that members of Principium be released to the Apgarian
      Confederacy and be tried according to their rules.
    - Separate from the requested military action, on the matter of the Town of
      Hama, they agree to a  multinational delegation to be sent to Raibon
      Island, with the proviso that they limit their security forces to at most
      4 person per civilian member, with a maximum of 4 civilian individuals per
      member state in attendance.
    - The Apgarian Government has recently heard that there is evidence of
      religious persecution in Port Surrey and Tidemark. That members of the
      Reformed Church of the Divine Masochist are being targeted by murders.
      They denounce such actions, and file protest under
      [Article XVIII](../../../world-novelty/treaty-of-turain.md#article-xviii).
      They assert that some individuals are Sanerian, and thus protected under
      Treaty of Turain statutes.

## Crew of the Principium

Until recently, there was no definite date set for the execution of the crew of
the Principium. However, because of the escape of one of the members (which was
not publicized), a date was announced in an attempt to pull the escapee from
hiding, or similarly, to spur La Camaraderie into action.
