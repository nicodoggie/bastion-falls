# Why was the TOTO meeting called? Why now?

1. La Camaraderie has been plaguing the Sarmatian Sea trade for a LONG time now.
   So, why does call on TOTO now?
   1. Maybe they have been calling TOTO, but requests for Special Meetings have
      been denied? But they could have raised the concerns during the Regular
      Meetings as well. Those are biannual, after all.
   2. Any of the recent events in and around Raibon?
      - The Appearance of the Town of Hama?
      - The change of the balance of power due to the downfall of the Parvese?
      - The disappearance and reappearance of the moon?
      - The disruption in trade due to the shuttering of the Liaison office of
        the Mirian Trading Company?
      - Free Theater activity?
      - Mehicanian activity?
      - Rumors of Bartholomew Strandiz IV living there?
      - All of the above?
   3. Why does Senera request for access? Why not Apgar?

Edmar may have been called upon because he recently investigated claims
regarding military activity on Raibon, under Article IX Section 4.2 regarding
the Enforcement of the Demilitarization of L'Illes Apgarie. This special meeting
may have been scheduled in order to hear the report regarding that
investigation.

Timeline of events:

- An individual had sent an anonymous report concerning a potential violation of
  the Treaty of Turain, specifically concerning Article IX Section 1, to the
  Treaty of Turain Liaison Office at Admiralty's Helm, Surrey-on-the-Brams.
- A list of potential evidence and claims seemed to have aligned with
  information gathered by the Royal Seneran Navy outside the designated
  Demilitarized Zones as defined in Appendix I
- A notice was sent to the Secretariat of the Treaty of Turain Organization, the
  Kingdom of Senera, would invoke its right under Article IX Section 4.2 to
  perform a surprise inspection under the guidelines specified in Appendix V of
  the Treaty.
- In accordance to aforementioned rules, two diplomats duly appointed by the
  Royal Seneran Diplomatic Corps would be assigned to perform the inspection
  under assumed identities
- The two diplomats assigned to the task are as follows:
  - Lord Marion Maxwell
  - Lord Edmar Pritchett
- The two diplomats were to meet with the individual that had claimed to have
  had information on the alleged violations of the Treaty.
- This individual identified herself as Lieutenant Paula Deloitte, who provided
  credentials associating her rank to the Apgarian Military. It is to be noted
  that the credentials provided was found to be a forgery. In reality, she was
  revealed to be Paula Abdul--the infamous actress and notorious criminal listed
  in the Red Book of Dangerous and Wanted Criminals of Sarmatia. Heretofore, she
  will be referred to as the Asset.
- The Asset claimed to have gained access to confidential information regarding
  military operations in Raibon Island, which involved mercenary groups who may
  have been taking orders from both Major Colonel Matthew Strandiz V, and the
  retired General General Bartholomew Strandiz IV, the latter of which was
  reportedly seen on said island.
- The Asset claimed that her superior officers had tried to sweep the matter
  under the rug, and that she had chosen, despite the risks to her career and
  her life, she wished to investigate further, and provide evidence directly to
  the Treaty of Turain Organization, who had the authority to deal with the
  matter.
- The Asset claimed that she believed that the Seneran authorities would be the
  ones with the most incentive to correct the matter, as the Demilitarized Zone
  was directly connected to Seneran waters.
- The Asset claimed that she was able to apply as an apprentice to the renowned
  actress Helene Nise as cover. Attempts to contact Mrs. Nise were unsuccessful
  however, as her aides have noted that Mrs. Nise was focused on completing the
  last stages of the construction of the Grand Guignol, a theater where her new
  production would have been presented. Said aides however, had confirmed that
  Paula Deloitte was in their employ.
- The Asset brought the diplomats to different parts of the island to provide
  evidence of wrongdoing by the Apgarian government. In order to mask our true
  purpose, she had arranged for us to be part of a tour group.
- The Asset had brought us to various homesteads and buildings on the island
  where we were to witness alleged Apgarian military personnel who were
  recruiting magic users on the island. These personnel were in plain clothing,
  but did show identification upon request. While the manner that they responded
  to questions were peculiar, the identification they furnished looked
  authentic.
- The Asset occasionally leaves the tour group to tend to "personal matters".
  The diplomat, Lord Pritchett, became curious and followed the Asset in secret.
  There he had learned that two of the other members of the tour, thespians
  Nathan Lain and James Cordyn were acquainted with the Asset. They were
  requesting an expedited audience with Helene Nise with whom they wished to
  work with. It was during this event that Lord Pritchett heard that the Asset
  was indeed Paula Abdul, former actress and notorious criminal.
- On the way to Hamlin, the thespians separated from the tour group, supposedly
  to prepare for a meeting with Mrs. Nise. After which, Lord Pritchett
  confronted the Asset about her true identity. She immediately confessed the
  truth about her identity, but said that she was hired to expose the dirt on
  the island. In fact, if they wanted, she'd arrange for a meeting with her
  employer.
- The diplomats were surprised when the Asset brought them to the Kraken, the
  infamous beached ship of Kincade Enterprises. There they were welcomed very
  lavishly, with the flamboyant Flancer Kincade talking about having a trade
  deal with Senera, mentioning that they were expanding the Kincade legitimate
  business, and "putting and end" to the endeavors that their family was known
  for. It was during this initial meeting where the diplomats were invited to a
  party. After which, they were to discuss goings-on in the island.
- However, at the day of the party, it became increasingly clear that the
  Kincades wish to broker some kind of trade deal in exchange for information.
  The diplomats had no authority over the matter of course, but in the spirit of
  self-preseivation, they acted accommodating, and accepted their hospitality
- During the party, Lord Pratchett overheard the Asset and Lord Maxwell speaking
  about a plan, one that would provide a "justification".
- Lord Pritchett attempted to confront Lord Maxwell about the matter, but he was
  rebuffed. Lord Maxwell said that he would "bring him into the fold" after the
  party.
- The party was uneventful until the fateful moment in the hot tub. Flancer
  Kincade, a member of the Tressemerian Coin Spinners, the Asset, and the
  diplomats were engaging in small talk, when a young woman called Maryanne
  joined. She had goaded the Asset to dispense some of her hallucinogenic
  mushrooms to help people relax. Indeed, those in the bath were so relaxed that
  they began engaging in sexual activity.
- The matter started getting out of hand, as the playfulness turned into
  aggressive behavior. Lord Pritchett in particular started engorging Lord
  Maxwell in his entirety, then Paula Abdul's sex organs. It was revealed later
  that Paula Abdul accidentally mixed a container of Moreaux Mushrooms into the
  bath, leading to the display of cannibalistic behavior.
