We have to actually try to make a oneshot that doesn't take forever to run.
There has to be a definite end point here.

Players will start at level 6, by default players ought to start with a human
variant. Players must consult the DM if the PCs are considering a non-human
species.

# Setting

The game will start somewhere in the island of
[Surrey-on-the-Brams](@/locations/port-surrey-on-the-brams.md). The exact
location depends on the background and chosen faction of the PCs.

They will eventually find themselves in
[the Narrows](@/locations/the-narrows.md) for various reasons, there they should
find themselves in the company of a dying
[Lord Marthur Malthren](@/characters/marthur-malthren.md), or the players may be
too late, depending on the timeframe in which they arrive.

Finally, they will head towards
[Surrey's Ear](@/locations/surrey-on-the-brams.md#surreys-ear) for the final
stage.

# Inciting Incident

News of the impending death of Lord Marthur Malthren has reached the ears of
various people of import across the island of Surrey-on-the-Brams. Being the
last living member of the Malthren family, his death will mean the end of his
noble line. The man was the Manor Lord of the Narrows, a dirty old township
tucked underneath the trees of the Keelswood, home to the many renegades and
villains of the Brams. As such, many believed that the old man had hidden vast
wealth in the family vaults.

In the twilight years of his life, the man had outright refused marriage
proposals to young maidens of noble families, scions of nouveau riche merchants,
of rival mercenary groups, who many thought were after the man's estate.

Famously, the man had no heirs, nor a will, and so upon his death, his estate
defaults to the crown, either to keep for themselves, or to distribute to some
petty nobility who had ingratiated themselves to the Dragonhearts.

A number of local factions see this as the only moment in time where they can
avoid some Dragonheart lordling from bandying their influence across the Brams.
After all, while the Writ of Nobility that comes with the estate of House
Malthrek only bestows a Baronetcy, it does also come with the ceremonial duties
of being Thane of the Magarisok, a title that would get the holder invited into
Castle Dragonheart during grand festivals.

# Peripheral Events

## Execution of the Principium Captives

Crewmembers of the Principium have been incarcerated in the Splits for close to
two years at this point. Captors have tried to break them, it's yet unclear if
they have succeeded. However a public execution has been scheduled for the 15th
of the 9th 1275.

## Treaty of Turain Organization Review

  [La Camaraderie de la Mer](@/organizations/la-camaraderie.md) as a group given
  letters of marque by the Apgarian Confederacy
- the anti-monarchist _Hickland for Hicks_ faction, and their potential
  connection to the Apgarian privateers

  purported immense power ih the L'Illes Apgarie Demilitarized Zone

## Assassination Attempts on the King of Senera

The King of Senera had cancelled a number of high profile appearances due to
three separate assassination attempts.

   king's ear
2. Unknown assailants attempted to infiltrate the King's ship cabin on a return
   voyage to Thantorbury

for the attacks.

# Factions

## Orthodox Church of the Divine Masochist

Every other month, at the insistence of Tidemark's Temple Representative,
[Sister Agatha Thralvig](@/characters/agatha-thralvig.md), the Church of the
Divine Masochist holds a mission to the Narrows. There they feed the hungry,
clothe the naked, and minister to the sick. They also hold vocational training
so that the locals are empowered to support themselves. Sister Agatha hopes that
by empowering the locals of the Narrows, they will be less prone to the
influence of the ne'er-do-wells that populate the township.

The Bishop of Surrey knows of this, and also heard of Malthren's terminal
illness. He wishes to send for someone to convince the old man to install a
pious follower of the Masochist to be his heir. So he had instructed a cadre of
his loyal paladins to escort the prospective candidate to the Narrows along with
Sister Agatha and her contingent.

The player can choose to be:

- the prospective candidate themselves. they must be a junior noble in a cadet
  branch.
- one of the paladins or clerics in the Bishop's retinue.
- a lay minister from Sister Agatha's contingent
- a person of good will who volunteers to help the locals of the Narrows

## House Surrata-Spellvig

House Surrata is the preeminent noble house of the Gulf of Inespell. Not only do
they hold the Lordship of Surrey-on-the-Brams, the Head of the House also gains
the title of Lord High Admiral of the Royal Navy of Senera. However, with any
prominent and storied house, there are always those junior members from cadet
branches who feel that they have been overlooked for too long.

Spurred on by his friends, Henry Surrata-Spellvig, a naval officer in training
from a branch of House Surrata from the outskirts of Cape Spellward wanted to
try to convince the dying Lord Malthren to name him as his heir. Henry's aide,
and spy for his mother, attempted to dissuade him, but to no avail. But at the
very least, he was able to convince the lad to hire a small contingent of
mercenaries to protect him on his mission.

The player can choose to be:

- Henry Surrata-Spellvig himself
- one of his friends who is also a naval officer in training
- one of the mercenaries who is hired to protect Henry
- Henry's aide

## Royal Navy of Senera

The Royal Navy of Senera is the naval arm of the Crown of Senera. They are
responsible for the defense of the Seneran Empire's overseas territories, and
for policing the Seneran Seas.

They have heard that operatives working for the Apgarian privateering group
[La Camaraderie de la Mer](@/organizations/la-camaraderie.md) were seen in the
Skelmals in the Narrows. The Admiralty beiieves that these operatives are
collecting intel on captured members of the Principium. These captives are
pivotal in the Admiralty's case against the Apgarians in an upcoming Treaty of
Turain Organization review.

The Admiralty would like to ensure that the captives would not be freed, or
killed before they have a chance to be tried.

The player can choose to be:

- a member of the Royal Navy of Senera
- a member of the Principium who overheard some rumors of the operatives' plans
- an intel operative of La Camaraderie de la Mer

## Hickland for Hicks

For the longest time the aristocrat pigs of Senera have been a leech on the hard
work of the common man! These sons and daughters of the Kalassarian interlopers
have been sucking the lifeblood of the Hicklands for far too long! That's right,
the Hicklands, Erkirgral, our land! It's time we took it back!

Old man Malthren had kept from us the legacy of the Thane of the Magarisok! At
the our of that miser's death, we will claim it for ourselves!

The player can choose to be any member of the Hickland for Hicks faction. A
player choosing this option have the most latitude in character creation, so as
long as they are radicalized Hicklanders.
