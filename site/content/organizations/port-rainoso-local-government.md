Being the capital of Raibon Island, but only one of two major ports, Rainoso's Local government has influence on the smaller townships on the island, even if they are technically about the same political level.

As is the standard set in the Apgarian Confederacy. the local government has 2 branches of government. The Minervan (executive) Office, and the Justitian (legislative) Council.

The Minervan Office
-------------------

The Minervan Office constitutes 2 elected positions and 4 appointed ministers. The former are the offices of the Mayor and Vice Mayor.

Mayoral Office  
--------------

The Vice Mayor is selected by the Mayor as a running-mate, and acts as a fallback if the Mayor is deemed unfit to run office. They also officiate the meetings of the Justitian Council as its speaker. Typically, the Vice Mayor has no vote in the Council, except to break ties in simple majority votes.

The Mayor is the executive head of a local government unit. They are in charge of approving, directing, and otherwise delegating the various projects, ministries and organizations under its auspices. They are also the commanding officer of the local gendarmerie.

The Mayor and Vice Mayor may serve 4 years in a single term. A Mayor may be elected for up to three terms in total. A Vice Mayor may be chosen an indefinite number of times for as long as they have not served more than three terms as Mayor.

#### The Ministries

Different municipalities and territories have different ministries and ministerial positions, but as a general rule of thumb, there cannot be more than 10. Rainoso itself has 3 ministers.  These ministers are appointed by the Mayor as they take office, and remain until they are either removed from office, or the tenure of the Mayor ends.

### The Justician Council

The Justician Council acts as the legislature and judiciary of the local government. They draft, enact and prosecute laws within their jurisdiction. There are two kinds of members within the the Justician Council:  the Drafters and the Justices.

Drafters are an elected position from amongst the citizens of a municipality or a district within that municipality. These Drafters are tasked with proposing new legislature based on the needs of their constituents and specific mandates. They act as representatives of the people within the government unit.

Justices are nominated and elected from a pool of judges and lawyers within the jurisdiction. They are tasked with managing the local court system and ruling upon matters of the law.

Both "houses" discuss, revise and vote upon bills, hear major trials etc
