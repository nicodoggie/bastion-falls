The **Seneran Royal Navy** is the maritime force of [Senera]
(@/locations/senera.md), responsible for protecting its waters, enforcing the
[Treaty of Turain](@/events/treaty-of-turain.md), and maintaining control over
trade routes in the Sarmatian Sea.

## Command Structure

Headquartered at [The Admiralty's Helm](@/locations/admiraltys-helm.md) in
[Port Surrey](@/locations/port-surrey-on-the-brams.md), the Navy operates under
the authority of the Lord High Admiral and the Admiralty Board.

## Fleet Organization

The Navy maintains several types of vessels for different maritime roles:

### Main Battle Fleet

Large warships operating in the Sarmatian Sea and major trade routes:

- Ships of the line
- Heavy frigates
- Armed merchantmen
- Supply vessels

### Patrol Vessels

Smaller craft for coastal and river operations:

- River patrol sloops
- Customs enforcement cutters
- Armed pilot boats
- Fast pursuit vessels

### Fleet Commands

#### Sarmatian Fleet

The Navy's largest formation, commanded by the Vice Admiral of the Sarmatian
Sea. Based primarily in Port Surrey, this fleet enforces the
[Treaty of Turain](@/events/treaty-of-turain.md) and maintains Seneran dominance
over Sarmatian trade routes:

- Treaty enforcement operations
- Major naval presence
- Merchant convoy protection
- Foreign port diplomacy
- Anti-piracy operations

#### Northeastern Fleet

Under the Vice Admiral of the Northeast, operating from the northeastern bay
[name to be determined]. This fleet faces the largely unexplored eastern ocean, focusing
on:

- Coastal defense against unknown threats
- Storm warning system maintenance
- Search and rescue operations
- Limited exploration missions
- Weather monitoring stations
- Protection of fishing fleets
- Monitoring of eastern waters

#### Rivers Command

Led by the Vice Admiral of Rivers, headquartered in Port Surrey with substations
throughout Senera's waterways:

- River patrol operations
- Customs enforcement
- Internal waterway security
- Flood response
- Ice-breaking duties
- Pilot services coordination

### Independence Period

When the Kalassarian Empire fell in 466 AI, Senera's established maritime
traditions and infrastructure allowed it to maintain stability while other
regions struggled. The Maidenfeld dynasty emerged during this transition period,
building on these naval capabilities.

### Northern Raids and Naval Evolution (c. 550-700 AI)

While dealing with piracy in the Sarmatian Sea, Senera faced a different
maritime threat: raiders from [Carlmark](@/locations/carlmark.md),
[Iutland](@/locations/iutland.md), and [Fayneland](@/locations/fayneland.md).
Their shallow-draft longships could strike anywhere along Senera's northern and
eastern coasts, often penetrating deep into river systems before the navy could
respond.

These raids drove significant changes in Seneran naval doctrine:

- Development of shallow-draft patrol vessels
- Establishment of coastal warning systems
- Construction of defended river stations
- Creation of rapid-response river squadrons
- Integration of local fishing boats into surveillance networks

The need to counter both northern raiders and Sarmatian pirates shaped the dual
nature of Senera's naval forces: deep-water vessels for open sea operations and
lighter craft for coastal and river defense. This versatility would later prove
crucial during the Poasan-Apgarian Conflict.

### Anti-Piracy Campaigns (c. 600-800 AI)

The collapse of imperial authority led to a surge in piracy across the Sarmatian
Sea. Senera, with its strategic position and inherited naval infrastructure,
found itself uniquely positioned to address this threat. What began as defensive
patrols to protect their own merchant vessels evolved into a broader campaign of
maritime security.

The navy developed specialized tactics during this period:

- Fast pursuit vessels for shallow-water chase
- Coordinated patrol patterns
- Intelligence networks in port cities
- Rapid response protocols
- Anti-boarding defenses

These campaigns not only secured Senera's waters but established them as a
defender of legitimate maritime trade, laying the groundwork for their later
role as regional naval power.

### Rise to Regional Power

### Early Naval Development (c. 466-550 AI)

Following independence, Senera's initial naval forces were largely ad hoc,
combining:

- Converted merchant vessels
- Local fishing fleets
- Coastal patrol boats
- Harbor defense craft

Naval facilities during this period shared space with commercial operations,
primarily in Port Surrey's original harbor. The Maidenfeld dynasty recognized
the need for dedicated naval infrastructure but lacked resources for major
development during the post-imperial transition.

### Naval Professionalization (c. 1150-1200 AI)

Growing maritime threats and trade interests drove significant organizational
changes:

- Establishment of the Admiralty Board
- Construction of dedicated naval facilities
- Development of permanent training programs
- Creation of standardized vessel classes
- Initial construction of the Admiralty Dockyards

This period saw the first true standing fleet, though still limited by the
declining availability of magic for large-scale operations.

### Modern Naval Complex (1225-Present)

The return of magic in 1225 AI sparked a revolutionary period of development:

- Integration of magical enhancement in shipbuilding
- Expansion of the Admiralty Dockyards
- Development of new tactical capabilities
- Modernization of training facilities
- Enhanced communication systems

The Poasan-Apgarian Conflict (1250-1255 AI) proved these developments crucial,
establishing Senera as the premier naval power in the region and leading to
their role as enforcers of the Treaty of Turain.
