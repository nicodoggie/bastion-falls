_The Thirteen_ is an autonomous military faction within the Poasan military.
During their formation shortly before the
[Poasan-Apgarian Conflict](@/events/poasan-apgarian-conflict.md), the group
consisted solely of women. Not only were male spellcasters exceedingly rare at
the time, but it was believed that male spellcasters wore a wildcard, as most of
them tended to cause Wild Magic.

Today, they are still made up of primarily women, but they have also started
recruiting promising male spellcasters.

## History

The Thirteen was officially founded in 1244 AI, approximately six years before
the outbreak of the
[Poasan-Apgarian Conflict](@/events/poasan-apgarian-conflict.md) in 1250 AI.
Their formation was, in part, a strategic military decision by the Kingdom of
Poasah in preparation for the growing tensions with the Apgarian Confederacy.

It is unknown exactly why their group was named _The Thirteen_, but there are
two common theories. The first is that they were originally a group of thirteen
women selected by the King of Poasah due to their magical ability. Second, is
that they chose that cursed number because none dared call their battalion the
13th, due to the stigma associated with the number.

## Notable Members

The Thirteen has included several notable members throughout its history:

- **Samantha Ardenne** - One of the heroes of the Poasan-Apgarian Conflict and
  member of The Thirteen. Historical records suggest she may have had
  connections to the Reformist church, with some sources indicating she may have
  acted as an informant or agent for Reformist interests within the
  organization.
- **Sirra Kita** - Eldest daughter of Duke of Trade, Coro Kita of Calamutz, who
  joined The Thirteen while serving at the Northeast Garrison at Fort
  Mountain-Foot

## Role in Poasan Affairs

The Thirteen maintains close ties with the Poasan government and religious
institutions. In recent times, members of The Thirteen have worked in
coordination with the clergy aligned with the Reformist church, gaining the
King's ear on matters of state importance. They have been tasked with sensitive
missions such as addressing plagues in Northern Poasah without resorting to
controversial methods.

Their influence extends beyond purely military matters, with members sometimes
serving in intelligence-gathering capacities both within Poasah and in
neighboring territories.

## Religious Alignments and Internal Politics

The relationship between The Thirteen and the Reformist church has been
particularly notable in recent history. While The Thirteen was originally
established as a secular military unit focused on magical warfare, certain
members have developed strong ties with Reformist clergy. This alliance has
granted both factions significant influence in the royal court.

However, this relationship has not been without controversy. There are
indications of internal divisions within The Thirteen regarding religious
alignment, with some members maintaining traditional loyalties while others have
embraced Reformist doctrine. These divisions have occasionally led to suspicions
of divided loyalties and potential compromises in the organization's cohesion.

## Military Achievements

The Thirteen played a crucial role in the Poasan-Apgarian Conflict, with
historical records suggesting they were instrumental in forcing the Apgarian
surrender. Their magical capabilities provided the Poasan forces with a
significant tactical advantage that ultimately helped bring the five-year
conflict to an end in 1255 AI.
