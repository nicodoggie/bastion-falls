The Secessionist Principalities, also known as the States of the Seditious
Princes, are a collection of independent states that broke away from the
Principality of [Kolha](@/locations/kolha.md) following the death of Prince
Kolha XVIII in 1250 AI.

# History

## Formation

After the death of Kolha XVIII, his seven children formed a coalition that
refused to accept a new prince appointed from mainland
[Ahuria](@/locations/ahuria.md). They argued that a mainland-appointed prince
could never truly understand the unique socio-political situation of the Kolhan
lands and their proximity to historical rivals.

The coalition commissioned a grand fleet to blockade the Mirian shore,
attempting to prevent the arrival of the newly ordained Kolha XIX. However,
mainland Ahurian forces, supported by privateers and mercenaries from Manascula,
Tanduaria, and Nura, eventually broke through.

## The Five Principalities

The five Secessionist Principalities that emerged from the
[Revolt of the Kolhan we do Ansa](@/events/revolt-of-the-kolhan-ansa.md) are:

- [Sur](@/locations/sur.md) (East of Kolha)
- [Kalamba](@/locations/kalamba.md) (East of Kolha)
- [Ar](@/locations/ar.md) (South of Kolha)
- [Mir](@/locations/mir.md)
- [Sarha](@/locations/sarha.md)

# Current Status

While these states have successfully maintained their independence from Kolha,
they remain in a complex political relationship with the greater Ahurian Empire,
from which they've effectively seceded.
