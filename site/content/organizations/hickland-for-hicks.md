# Hickland for Hicks

A radical anti-monarchist organization advocating for the return of Hickland
(Erkirgral) to its original inhabitants. The group has gained notoriety for its
militant stance against the Seneran Crown and its aristocracy.

## Overview

Hickland for Hicks represents a growing movement that seeks to reclaim what they
view as their ancestral lands from the "aristocrat pigs of Senera" and the
descendants of Kalassarian interlopers. Their ideology centers on the belief
that the current noble class has been exploiting the common people of the
Hicklands for generations.

## Names and Identity

While publicly known as "Hickland for Hicks" - a deliberately accessible name
chosen for recruitment and wider recognition - members internally refer to
themselves as _Erkirgral_. This internal name serves as both an identifier of
true membership and a connection to their perceived ancestral heritage. Most
modern Senerans, even those sympathetic to the cause, would not recognize this
term.

The organization strategically employs both names: "Hickland for Hicks" for
public discourse and propaganda, making their anti-aristocratic stance
immediately clear to potential supporters, while _Erkirgral_ functions as a
password of sorts among committed members, used in private meetings and secret
correspondence.

## Etymology and Language

The organization claims _Erkirgral_ derives from Early Hickic elements (_er-_
"one who" + _kir_ "chest" + _gral_ "land"). However, linguistic scholars note
several issues with this construction. The agentive marker _'er_ was
historically used as a suffix, not a prefix, and the actual Early Hickic term
for "person" was _'al_, with _ma'al_ serving as its collective form.

Members refer to each other individually as _erkir_, reflecting their
misunderstanding of Early Hickic grammar but establishing a consistent internal
terminology. This practice has become deeply embedded in their organizational
culture, with phrases like "true erkir" marking someone as a trusted member.

This imperfect scholarship reveals much about the organization: while they
maintain deep passion for their heritage and have acquired some knowledge of
Early Hickic, their understanding remains incomplete. Nevertheless, they
continue to pepper their communications with what they believe to be "pure"
Hickic terms.

The term "Hick" itself is embraced by the movement, transformed from a
Kalassarian pejorative into a badge of pride in public discourse, while
maintaining their "purer" linguistic identity within the organization - even if
that identity isn't quite as historically accurate as they believe.

## Activities and Operations

### Political Violence

The organization has claimed responsibility for several high-profile attacks,
including three assassination attempts on the King of Senera:

1. A crossbow attack during a tournament at Rannekford
2. An attempted infiltration of the King's ship cabin
3. A poisoning attempt in the Maltrek Highlands

### Base of Operations

The group maintains a significant presence in The Narrows, particularly
operating from The Lazy Hick, a dilapidated wooden longhouse that serves as
neutral ground for various criminal elements. This establishment is directly run
by the organization.

### Alliances and Connections

Recent intelligence suggests possible connections between Hickland for Hicks and
Apgarian privateers, particularly La Camaraderie de la Mer. This alliance is
currently under investigation by the Treaty of Turain Organization and the
Admiralty.

## Ideology

The group's core beliefs include:

- Opposition to the Seneran monarchy
- Rejection of Kalassarian-derived nobility
- Advocacy for traditional Hickic culture and identity
- Support for common people's rights
- Resistance against aristocratic control

## Current Activities

The organization appears to be expanding its influence, particularly in The
Narrows and the rest of the Brams River Valley. There are indications they may
be involved with:

- Underground maritime operations
- Alternative commerce networks
- Information trading
- Resistance activities against crown authority

## Notable Locations

### The Lazy Hick

Their primary known establishment in The Narrows, serving as both a meeting
point and operational center.

### Vortex Cove

A hidden harbor rumored to house ships belonging to Hickland separatists,
accessed through secret paths near Malthren Manor.

## Historical Context

The movement has gained additional momentum in recent years, partially due to
the current king's initial attempts to appease them through the revival of
Hickic culture. However, this cultural revival appears to have backfired,
instead strengthening the separatist movement's resolve.
