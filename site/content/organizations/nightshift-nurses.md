A popular adult magazine established in 1269 AI, distributed within the
[Apgarian Confederacy](@/locations/apgar.md). It is run by the organization
called the [Ministry of Science](@/organizations/ministry-of-science.md).

## Purpose and Content

While ostensibly an adult entertainment publication, Nightshift Nurses serves a
covert educational purpose. The Ministry of Science uses the magazine's explicit
imagery as a vehicle to disseminate fact-based and evidence-based information to
the adult population. This approach allows scientific and empirical knowledge to
reach readers who might otherwise not have access to or interest in such
information.

## Publication and Distribution

While officially sanctioned by the Ministry of Science, the magazine's
distribution is carefully controlled within Apgarian territories. Its content
and editorial direction reflect the complex relationship between state control
and popular media in the Confederacy.
