Falls🔗\nThe year: 1275 and the world is in the brink of a disaster of a scale that was\nnot even thought possible.\n50 years ago, Bastion, considered the most important city by many states and\nreligions in the land, had been consumed by an inexplicable dark orb of massive\nproportions. Since then, trade networks have been disrupted, religious belief\nhad been shaken to their foundations, and strange, mythological monstrosities\nhave begun ravaging the lands.\nSince the Fall of Bastion, people have begun exhibiting powers that were once\nbelieved to be utter fantasy--powers attributed to the gods and goddesses of\ndays before history. Some have begun to use their newly-obtained powers for\ntheir personal gain, believing that they were granted such marvelous feats as\ndivine affirmation of their rule. And yet some, have used their talent for the\nbetterment of all.\nWhat had caused the Fall of Bastion? Where do these powers manifest from? Are\nthese the End of Days, as prophesied millennia ago?\nHow It Came To Be🔗\nI was actually developing a different long term campaign that would be radically different, with a number of \nhomebrew races, classes and rulesets built upon the D&amp;D 5e system. I had all these notes and ideas, but it I needed more\ntime to get them ready. My wife wanted to play a game in the meantime.\nSo I planned to make the most generic, cliché setting that wasn't set in a published setting, so I can just make shit\nup as I went along (my brain won't let me do that in an established setting for some reason). So I invented some regions \nand ethnicities that had some analogues in the real world. Bastion was kind of like Constantinople, and the Fall coincided,\nyear wise, more or less, with the year that Constantinople fell to the Turks.\nBetera was more or less Europe, with a late medieval flavor, and its polities were descendants of a broken empire, the Kalassar,\nwho were basically Romans. I set it up as a low-magic setting so that I wouldn't have had to explain how society \nevolved with magic. Then all of a sudden, some unexplained cataclysm poured magic out into the world. Then blondies became magic.\nI needed a religion, so I went with a lampoon of Christianity called Divine Masochism, and then they were fighting against a \nfundamentalist reform subset called the \"Reformists\".

The player characters involved are the following:\n\nBartholomew IV Strandiz\nEmily Hazeldine\nNarmaya\nLevallier de la Fouet\n\nThese two pairs have separate ultimate goals as they head into the town of Hugo. The former are merely traveling into the Mountains via the doorway that connects it with the Turbiere de Hubar in order to quickly head into Mayonne, where supposedly the soulless body of Matthew V Strandiz is wandering. The latter are in search for another vampire who supposedly once resided in these mountains. Collectively, during the Hugo portion of the campaign, the party would have an average party level of 10, which would be tough to prepare for in a lower magic setting.\nTo further complicate issues, currently, Bart Strandiz is in the Feywild, and traveling from that plane to Thera causes random temporal shifting to occur. The randomness has to be accounted for, as there are certain world events with fixed dates. As it relates to this particular campaign, Phantasmagoria is set to happen on the 13th day of the 9th month. EV said that in case the rolls were so bad, the other three might want to head to Hugo even before Strandiz would come back from the feywild. This is because Phantasmagoria might be one of the only venues where they could find clues on the vampire they're looking for, and also taking even more time than what has already elapsed since the Free Theater had disposed of Matthew Strandiz' body may decrease the chances that they would be able to find him.\nCurrent State of Things\nHugo\nCurrently, the Hags of Hama and La Camaraderie jointly hold the \"doorway\" that connects Raibon Island with Walburton House in Hugo. They routinely ensure that any Reformist agents are not able to retake control and send more people into Raibon Island. There were some Reformist scouts that have been sent to the area recently, who were easily dealt with, and subsequently transformed into Frogmen by members of the Hags of Hama.\nBut in the run-up to Phantasmagoria, with more people have been entering the area, it is becoming harder to track new arrivals and confirm whether or not they are Reformists. Within the past month, the various inns and taverns, as well as some personal homes, people from various parts of Apgar, Poasah, Mehicania, Tanduaria, Calamutz, Ahuria and even from as far East as Sarebia and Haram. These foreigners and their various motivations and prejudices don't necessarily jive well with each other, and had begun to cause some tensions in the area. Not even to say whether or not some of them may be Reformist agitators.\nFactions at play\n\nLa Camaraderie\nHags of Hama\nReformists\nThe Thirteen\nDevotees of the Angel of Nature\nVampires of Alsace\n\nLa Camaraderie and the Hags of Hama\nThe fact that Somme Privatea was given an invitation to the auction at Wunderplat Hospital at all was due to rumors that La Camaraderie might have been attempting to bolster their numbers with spellcasters outside of Apgar's official sphere of influence. Iluvia Wunderplat herself knew that Raibon Island might actually be fertile ground for spellcasters to develop, and so wished to see how far along they've gotten, if they have gotten anything at all. being one of Phantasmagoria's largest sponsors, she used a ticket to the secret magical event to probe what they knew at the time.\nSanery\nSenera\nMotivations\nTo actually prep for this game, let's dig in to the various motivations that led to the current state the entities involved are in.\n\n  Why was Matthew V Strandiz' soul taken?\n  \n    The obvious reason might be to take institutional knowledge of the Apgarian military from a person of such high military rank as him. Being a Major Colonel in charge of magical personnel would potentially leak the means in which Apgar tracks magical individuals.\n    If it were some kind of magical ability or effect, then capturing his soul would allow them to draw out the power somehow. If it were an artifact, they could use his knowledge to find and retrieve said artifact.\n    But why separate his body from his soul at all? Well, he's a high-level caster and was causing them trouble. Separating body from soul would remove that as an issue... So maybe Matthew delved into divination despite Bart IV's misgivings about that branch of magic? Maybe he'd found the way to cast \n\nscrying. I think this is what I prefer as a reason. He'd finally cracked one of the ultimate in detection spells. Or perhaps he has a spell called \n\nmass scrying that would be beyond his spell level, but he might have had access to enhancer orbs that would have allowed him to cast it.\n  \n  \n    Why was his body dumped in Mayonne? Why might it actually still be there?\n  \n  \n    As his soul has been collected for whatever reason, his body may have had its value, but Andre Delarde had some beef with the man and wanted to basically desecrate his body. Placing some kind of enchantment and illusion spell on Matthew Strandiz' body as it meanders in Mayonne's city streets as some kind of cruel punishment.\n    It's been a while at this point, so the body has likely been collected. I haven't decided who yet... I do have time until we get to Mayonne tho, and I do want to get to that location for sure.\n    We do have some options on what has been done to the man's body tho.\n    Option 1: It's been taken by the Poasans to use as a spy.\n    Option 2: Some internal faction ahd used his body to further their goals\n    Option 3: Reformists use his body for breeding purposes. His soul might be absent, but his body definitely has those magical Strandiz genes.\n  \n  Why do they actually want to go to Phantasmagoria?\n  \n    Originally, Hedwig, Cotto and the others want to go to Phantasmagoria for the simple reason that the occult interests them greatly. Though they still have great interest in the occult, they've since grown to face the responsibilities that they've been bestowed. The date of Phantasmagoria is too close to the execution of the crew of the [Principium](@/vehicles/principium.md) for them to have the time to join. Since Narmaya wants to learn about the other known vampire though, Phantasmagoria may be the best chance for just that.\n  \n\nOther notes\n\n  Can one detect that a different \"soul\" is in someone else's body?\n  \n    The \n\nlocate creature may be confused when trying to locate a specific creature if its original \"soul\" was removed from it. If the spell is used to specifically find the creature's body, roll a DC 15 intelligence ability check, on a success you may be directed toward the creature's body. If not, the spell will attempt to find the location of the soul.\n    \n  What is a \"soul\" anyway&gt;\n  \n    Even the most ardently atheist magic user in the world of Thera would have to concede that a *soul* exists within every creature of the world, as a number of spells and magic artifacts are capable of manipulating them, or outright pulling them out from a body.\n    Prevailing non-secular thought would define a soul as an imprint of a person's identity, or ego, which resides within their mind. \n  \n\nVampire Lore\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/campaign-prep-searching-for-a-body-and-a-soul/","path":"/blog/campaign-prep-searching-for-a-body-and-a-soul/","title":"Campaign Prep: Searching for a Body and a Soul"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/knot/":{"body":"The edge of the desk beneath my shaky fingers\nTapping nervously with a furious emotion that lingers\nBlazing at a hundred words per minute\nJust trying my best to wing it\nBut it all comes crashing\nThe interface keeps hanging\nAs the screen blares blue\nHexes dropping in the monotone hue\nStaying frozen past reboot\nCan't even fix it as root\nIt's time to shutdown\nSorry I let you down\nJust going through a little meltdown\nPlaylist roaring some motown\nIt's not that I want not\nIt's more like, I cannot\nFor some reason, things just would not\nFeels like I'm in a knot\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/knot/","path":"/blog/knot/","title":"Knot"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/puddle/":{"body":"I dreamt that I was a puddle\nAmorphous on a city street\nBorn from pipe, not from cuddle\nI laid there, stabbed by feet\nUp above shone the sun\nIts painful rays shooting heat\nWhile for most it was fun\nI felt a lot less upbeat\nInto vapor none can see\nNothing to do but to stare\nWhile the radiance ate at me\nI slowly boiled into the air\nInto vapor, no longer me\nAs I boiled into the air\nNothing is left of me\nFor the radiance does not care\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/puddle/","path":"/blog/puddle/","title":"Puddle"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/sea-hags-the-story-so-far-part-1/":{"body":"We've been playing the Sea Hags campaign set in the world of Bastion Falls'\nThera for three years now apparently, and it seems that I've forgotten more\nabout what had happened than I've ever been able to transcribe in this site\n(since I only started this about a year ago). So in an effort to remember\neverything that's happened since, I've been trying to collate all of the\ndisparate notes and pieces of information that I could collect. But I've been\nreally sloppy with mzy notes, and it's become such a pain.\nStarting with this post, I will be attempting to reconstruct the events that\nhave happened so far, using EV's Google Docs notes as a base, then integrating\nsome of my notes to get an accurate picture of what is going on. EV's notes\nmight be somewhat more complete than mine, but it's mostly a collection of\none-liners that needs some interpretation now that we've lost a LOT of context.\nAlso, some of the information in older portions of the campaign might no longer\nsquare with current story-telling due to forgetfulness, narrative shifts,\nchanges due to derailment--you know, stuff that happens to campaigns when\nplayers start mucking around in it. So there will be attempts to square the\nreconstructed narrative with the most up-to-date versions of what's going on.\nAnother issue is a reconstruction of the dates. EV's notes DON'T have any of\nthat, so maybe I can get away with making this stuff up along the way, but I'll\nhave to at least square it up with the current games, where I started actually\ntracking those myself. I should have actually made better notes myself, and I do\nhope to actually get this right when I start running these games again.\n\nBackground\nDuring the last few centuries of the Silent Ages,\nthe House of the Dragonheart reigned over the\nKingdom of Sanery, which held a huge\npart of Northern Apgarian Territories. They served as a client kingdom to the\nSeneran House of\nMaidenfeld, their cousins across the Princely\nChannel.\nHowever, in the 900s, two successive kings of Senera, in their failed bid to\nexpand their territories southward and to the east, have lost favor with various\nfactions within Senera. The noble class who have bankrolled the many failed\nskirmishes against the kingdoms of\nAnasai and\nEstrega, have become disillusioned\nafter many of the promises of land and wealth have not materialized after\ndecades. The country's food supplies have been appropriated by the king to \"feed\nthe war effort\", which meant that the peasantry were left with little to eat.\nYoung men of fighting age were conscripted into their liege lord's banners to\nwage war beyond the country's borders, and because of the mismanagement of the\nwar effort most of them died, never to return to their families again. The\ndiscontent across the entire spectrum of Sanerian society left the country\nespecially susceptible to the agitation of the revolutionaries that began the\nFirst Apgarian Revolution that spread\nfrom the Central Apgarian kingdoms of Baraon, Carmar and Mayonne.\nThe House of the Dragonheart was forced to flee Sanery, into Senera in hopes of\ngarnering support with the Maidenfelds to retake their land back from the\nrevolutionaries. In the midst of the clashes between the pro-royalists and the\nrevolutionaries, the House de la Tierre seized control of Sanery with the aid of\nforces from the Kingdom of Anasai, ending both the northern front of the First\nApgarian Revolution and the Sanerian Dragonheart Dynasty.\nEventually, the Dragonhearts were able to supplant the Maidenfelds as the ruling\ndynasty in Senera and would rule the country until the present day. They never\nforgot their Sanerian homeland however. So when the Poasan Empire invoked mutual\ndefense treaties for a Divine Alliance\nduring the Poasan-Apgarian Conflict,\nthey did not hesitate to immediately declare war against the fledgling Apgarian\nConfederacy.\nSenera was able to take Sanery two years into the war. Their superior naval\nforces were eventually able to suppress Apgar's small handful of frigates and a\nmishmash of repurposed privately-held ships. By the end of the war however, most\nof the Sanerian territories were won back by the Apgarians, with the exception\nof Port Sanery and Castle Dragonheart. Ultimately, the Divine Alliance were able\nto force the Apgarian forces into a conditional surrender, but only after\nmassive losses on all sides. In the end, the resulting Treaty of\nTurain saw these remaining Sanerian holdings\nceded these territories back to the Apgarians, under the condition that trade\nalong the Sarmatian Sea was patrolled and taxed\nby the Seneran Navy.\nIn order to undermine the Seneran Navy's hold on sea trade, a selection of\npirates and smugglers willing to work with the Apgarian government were issued\ncommissions. This led to the formation of La Camaraderie de la\nMer which hid behind its official\nconstitution as a Sailor's Guild. It was, instead, an organization formed to\nstreamline the government's efforts to fund privateers to raid goods from\nofficial Seneran trade vessels and their naval escorts.\n\nDay 1\nSetting: La Carnalis\nCast of Characters:\n\nHedwig Rosa Rosenkrantz aka Helda Stark\n\nOnly daughter of Duke Bain Rosenkrantz of Salicy and Karen Rosenkrantz neé\nGuildenstern\n\n\nJean-Paul de la Fouet\n\nCaptain of La Carnalis\n\n\nCraçoix\n\nFirst Mate\n\n\nSomme Privatea\n\nQuartermaster\n\n\nCotto\n\nMysterious hooded passenger\n\n\nSister Sierre Leveroux\n\nNun of the Order of the Angels of Delight\n\n\nDominguez Tailleur\n\nDeckhand\n\n\nTimon\n\nDeckhand\n\n\n\nOn the last leg of La Carnalis' month-long journey from the Mirian\nIslands to Port\nRainoso, a pair of Seneran Frigates forced the\nLa Carnalis to a full stop and prepare for inspection as per the terms of the\nTreaty of Turain. Hedwig Rosa Rosenkrantz, under the assumed name of Helda\nStark, was working as a deckhand for close to a month was unprepared for what\nwas about to transpire. What she thought was a regular transport vessel, was\nactually a pirate ship.\nThe first mate, a sadistic man by the name of Craçoix, ordered a full stop. The\ncrew seemed tense, standing in anticipation of something that Hedwig knew would\nbe trouble. Then as soon as one of the Seneran Frigates prepared to board the La\nCarnalis, one of the other deckhands, a tall and gangly fellow named Timon, shot\na ballista bolt across the Frigate's port-side bow, hitting the navy vessel's\nforemast. Immediately, the Seneran captain of the frigate ordered his men to\nboard the La Carnalis, swords between their teeth.\nThe pirate crew was ready to face the interlopers, weapons drawn. As the forces\nclashed upon the deck, it was obvious that the crew of the La Carnalis were no\nmere sailors. They fought in a well-coordinated, professional manner that could\nhave been an even match for Salicy's regular army men. In short order, the\nthirty-odd Seneran navy-men were driven off the deck, most of them falling into\nthe treacherous Sarmatian waters.\nThe second Seneran Frigate launched a large metal ball at the beleaguered ship,\ndamaging its aft mast and portions of its hull. Hedwig was ordered to evacuate\nthe passengers below deck to keep them from harms way--not a moment too soon, as\na metal ball collapsed the quarters that Hedwig and Sister Sierre Leveroux\nshared, ruining a prized dress given by Hedwig's parents.\nAfter taking the sister, and a mysterious hooded person named Cotto, into the\nhold, Hedwig immediately Ran to the deck to see if she could help. In a moment\nof desperation, Hedwig suddenly heard voices in her head: \"Come here...\", it\nbeckoned. In that instant, power welled up from within her. She instinctively\ngestured her right hand at the attacker. A mote of fire erupted from the tip of\nher fingers onto the frigate. The arcane projectile hit its target and burned\nits mainsail. The resulting flame caused the Seneran crew to panic, effectively\ndisabling the opposing ship. The momentary distraction allowed La Carnalis to\nescape between the labyrinthine islets of L'Illes\nApgarie.\n\nDue to the extensive damage La Carnalis had received from the Seneran catapults,\nnot to mention some of the injuries members of the crew had sustained, the\ncaptain directed the ship to L'Illes Descargar, a remote islet within L'Illes\nApgarie, to receive necessary repairs.\nWhile underway, Hedwig overheard Somme, ship's quartermaster, and Captain\nJean-Paul discuss the \"stash\" that the Frigates were probably after. Apparently,\non their voyage to the Mirian Islands, La Carnalis raided a Seneran trade\nvessel. They were tasked to retrieve some cargo that it was handling. It did not\ntake long for them to notice Hedwig listening by the door, so they called her\nin.\nCaptain Jean-Paul noted that what Hedwig had done on the deck was a rare ability\nthat the ancients called the Ritma. Somme revealed that they were looking for\nsomeone like her, and the fact that she had the tell-tale signs of a\nspellcaster--her yellow-eyes--was the reason why they accepted her application.\nShe revealed why she had joined the crew of La Carnalis in the first place: that\nsomething or someone was guiding her to an island in the Sarmatian Sea. An agent\nshe trusted who used the alias Blue Fluffy\nUnicorn, arranged for her to become a\nmember of the crew.\nHedwig, in confidence, revealed that her name was not Helda Stark. Her real name\nwas Hedwig Rosa Rosenkrantz, only daughter of Nuran Duke Bain Rosenkrantz of\nSalicy and Karen Guildenstern. She told the pair that she suspected that the\nvoice she kept hearing, as well as her magic, might be related to the strange\ncircumstances of her birth. When she was young she'd hear whispers from the\ngossip-mongers in high-society that her father was impotent, and her birth might\nhave been illegitimate. As she grew older, she had become increasingly curious\nwhether or not allegations that her mother had taken the seed of another man,\nsince Hedwig herself did not inherit any physical features from her father.\nEventually, her mother admitted in confidence that they had difficulties in\nconceiving her. They had traveled to a far away land to meet a coven of witches\nthat would be able to grant them a child.\nShe hired Blue Fluffy Unicorn, who she'd contracted in the past to search for\nvarious occult artifacts and books, to find out more about what her mother told\nher. He found that Hedwig might be what was called a hexblood--a person borne\nfrom an exchange with a group of magical women called Hags. He arranged travel\nfor her to head to the Mirian Islands, in order tp find passage to Port\nRainoso, a prominent trading town in Raibon Island\nin the western seas of Apgar.\nSomme and Jean-Paul then explained to her that they and every member of the crew\nof La Carnalis were members of La Camaraderie de la Mer, a group borne out of\nthe Poasan-Apgarian Conflict. Two years prior, the pair served as officers of an\nentirely different ship called the Principium, with Jean-Paul as first mate,\nand Somme as its quartermaster. During a transport operation, they had run afoul\nof three Seneran frigates, intent in capturing what they were hauling. Neither\nof them knew what they were hauling, nor did their captain at the time, but they\nwould attempt to escape from these Frigates, to no avail. Members of the crew\nwere captured, but a few, including Somme, Jean-Paul, and Captain Jethro, were\nexpelled from the ship as a result of an explosion. They recently heard some\nmembers of the Principium survived, and were due for trial and execution.\nKnowing that the Apgarian government would not risk a diplomatic incident to\nliberate their former crew mates, they were planning a rescue operation. Since\nthe war twenty years ago, the Seneran Navy flaunted the fact that they had\nspellcasters within their ranks. Tt would be near-impossible for the non-magical\ncrew of La Carnalis to infiltrate the navy prison complex at Port\nSurrey-on-the-Brahms. Somme admitted\nthat he had an idea that she was a spellcaster due to her eye-color, and had\nallowed her to work in La Carnalis despite her obvious lack of experience.\nSomme had offered to help Hedwig find the truth about her origins, in exchange\nof membership in La Camaraderie and her assistance in liberating the\nincarcerated crew of the Principium. Hedwig accepted, under the condition that\nthey replace the dress that was ruined by the earlier sortie, and that she be\ngiven an officer's quarters, instead of being forced to stay in the crew\nquarters below decks. Somme balked at the latter point, since there were no more\nspare rooms--they can only repair the hull in Descargar because of time\nconstraints. This meant that they don't even have enough room for the\npassengers, much less for Hedwig's demands for a new room. In response, Hedwig\nproposed the following:\n\nCaptain Jean-Paul move his quarters into the Captain's Chambers\nSister Sierre, whose room was destroyed in the encounter, be quartered in the\ncaptain's former arrangements\nHedwig's expensive dress, which was ruined, would be replaced upon arrival at\nPort Rainoso\nShe be given Somme's quarters instead\n\nSomme was inflexible. He did not want to have to give up his quarters for this.\nHedwig could just probably share with Sister Sierre instead, and they would\nrefund part of her fare. As a compromise, Hedwig proposed that she share\nchambers with Somme, splitting the room in two. Somme reluctantly accepted after\nsome pressure from Jean-Paul. Hedwig then signed a Letter of Intent to join La\nCamaraderie, which sealed their deal.\nOnce the document was signed, Jean-Paul told Hedwig that there was a brothel on\nDescargar called the Shriek Shack that housed a coven of hags called the Hags\nof Estrega. While they were known as \"hags\"\ndue to their occupation as prostitutes, they also practiced the old traditions\nthat allowed hags to perform feats of magic as a group. He thought that the\nleader of the group, Atroya, might know something about those voices.\n\n  Info\n\n  The Hag was an in-world mythological creature and was\nprominently featured in Apgarian and many northern folklore. From about the\n1000s, the word came to be  used colloquially to refer to a prostitute. The term\ncoven, used in folklore to describe a collection of hags or witches co-evolved\nand was used to refer to a brothel.\nThe change in their definition may have stemmed from the stigmatization of pagan\nfolklore by the Masochist Church, which in turn was due to their prohibitions on\nmagic.\n\n\n\nAfter deftly maneuvering between the many narrow channels and isthmuses of the\nIsles of Apgaria, they arrived at an islet set upon the bones of dead corals and\nsediment. L'Ille Descargar was a platform built upon this atoll, and was known\nonly to a handful of smugglers and pirates who dodged Seneran Navy patrols. Upon\nthe platform were small thatch cottages that house the shipwrights, sailors,\nmerchants and whores that make a living from these fugitives. The platform\nextends into a natural harbor where ships as large as galleys might take port\nfor repairs and relaxation.\nAs an apology for the ordeal, the captain offered to compensate their few\npassengers, including Sister Sierre Leveroux, the mysterious Cotto, and a few\nothers, by paying for any expenses they would incur while on the isle. Sister\nSierre's quarters in particular, had been ruined due to the skirmish, so her\nmeager belongings may have to be replaced. In addition, upon Hedwig's\ninsistence, the captain would relinquish his own quarters to the nun for the\nrest of the journey, as her previous room may stay in a state of disrepair.\nDuring the docking procedures, Hedwig had time to converse with Sister Sierre.\nHer order sent her to represent their interests in Port Rainoso and the larger\nRaibon Island. They heard rumor that heretics were trying to establish\nthemselves on the island, and was doing so because the influence of the Church\nof the Divine Masochist was especially weak on the island. It's sole church\nthere had only a small handful of adherents, and only one parish priest serving\nit.\nCotto, on the other hand, remained quiet, and said only responded with gestures\nand grunts when Hedwig tried to make conversation as they waited for the ship to\ndock.\nOnce docked, the passengers and half of the members of the crew, including\nHedwig who was still using the alias Helda Stark, were allowed to disembark on\nthe platform of Descargar. The crew scattered to various parts of the isle for\ntheir R&amp;R. Hedwig opted to stay with Sister Sierre, and invited the quiet Cotto\nto come with them to explore. One of the deckhands, Dominguez Tailleur, whom\nHedwig called Dominic every time they interacted, was assigned to take them\naround the island--specifically to mind Hedwig. Dom not only has been to\nDescargar before, he also spoke the local language: a dialect of the\nEstregan tongue.\nDom first brought them to a General Store that basically sold goods dropped by\nsmugglers and pirates who needed to pay for their repairs. There, they purchased\nclothes and swimwear to replace some of the ones ruined during the Seneran\nsortie earlier in the day. They also attempted to convince Cotto to wear\nsomething other than his cloak. Hedwig bought him a floral designed shirt and\nshorts to dress him with something colorful instead. As she brought him to the\ndressing room, however, she was surprised by Cotto's true appearance. He had\ncrimson skin, two solid stumps on his forehead, a pair of goat-like legs, a thin\nleathery tail, and an exceptionally large scaly penis in the middle of them.\nCotto was obviously shy about his appearance, as he shied away, seemingly\nexpecting disgust from Hedwig's face. Hedwig is not one to discriminate in that\nway though, actually she was fascinated by Cotto's infernal appearance,\nespecially because of her interest in the occult. Concerned about Cotto's\ndistress though, she suggested that they give him shorts that can conceal his\ngoat legs.\nAfter they'd purchased the replacement supplies, Hedwig suggested that they\ncelebrate the fact that they survived the attack. She basically ordered Dom to\nbring them them to an appropriate spot. He brought them to a popular rest spot\nin the southern end of the platform--a group of cottages run by a loose\ncollection of locals that sold various edible goods and refreshments to\nvisitors. These locals, both men and women, were scantily clad and\naccommodating--ready to serve anything they had to appease their customers, for\na price. The group ordered a local beverage, coco rum, a rum flavored with\nshaved coconut meat, served inside a fresh coconut shell. Even Cotto, who said\nthat he wasn't used to drinking alcohol was goaded into taking some, since his\ndrink of choice--milk--wasn't available.\nWhile drinking, the group started getting more acquainted with each other.\nSister Sierre mentioned that she was a member of the Convent of the Society of\nthe Angel of Delight in the\nSonima state of Southern Apgar. The reason she did not\nhave many belongings that needed to be replaced, was that on of the Society's\ntenets was the Light of\nPoverty.\nAdherents were to carry what is absolutely necessary, in order for them to more\nappreciate, share, and experience delight in its various forms. She also\ndispelled the notion that all nuns had vows of chastity, stating that only nuns\nfrom the Order of the Angel of\nJustice had such\nprohibitions. It's just because that order of clergy were the most prevalent in\nApgar. Outright sexual relations was not banned, but it must be guided by a\nsense of connecting spiritually with their partner when during the act.\nHedwig then ordered a plate of the local delicacy while speaking in the Estregan\nlanguage, which surprised everyone, Dom especially. She told them that her\nmother taught her how to speak the language along with many others since the\nwoman was someone who \"enjoys learning about different cultures\". She, of\ncourse, does not mention that her mother is a Guildenstern, a family renowned\nfor their patronage and performance of the arts.\nThe group was served an Estregan dish called Maherazi, a pungent fermented\nfish with a pasty consistency, wrapped in dried seaweed. She noted that the sour\nand savory flavor strangely had hint of the taste of beef. The powerful scent is\nusually enough to put off any of the uninitiated, but Hedwig was adventurous\nenough brave through the stink, while Sierre and Dom actually liked the dish.\nCotto on the other hand was already too drunk to even notice the scent.\nDom grew up eating the stuff as he was a native of mainland Estrega, one of the\nstates that made up the Apgarian Confederacy. He told them about his parents and\nthat he came from a line of garment makers, and the reason for why he left.\nApparently, his mother's shop was being beaten by Seneran boutiques that\ndominated the Estregan market in the years after the war. In an attempt to\nexpand her clientele, she took out a loan to get a shop in a better location and\nbetter raw materials, but something happened that caused her to default on those\nloans. Dom left so that he could help pay off that loan. Eventually he'd find\nhimself as part of La Camaraderie.\nAs the day turned into night, they enjoyed more conversation and drink. They\nbegan ordering various beers and wines, so they began talking about the Hags of\nEstrega and the Shriek Shack. Dom doesn't know about the hags' magical\nabilities, but he does mention that they offer pretty good massages.\nCotto, who was usually silent, was also inebriated enough to have been goaded\ninto talking about himself. He was a creature called a\nCornups by the scholars of Eastern Betera. It was said\nthat one in five hundred thousand births resulted in the birth of one. Their\nclose resemblance to the Masochist conception of the Devil, however, usually\ncauses fear and derision in the general populace. Cotto's experience was no\ndifferent. His parents kicked him out of the house as soon as they could no\nlonger hide his devilish traits.\nSierre and\nHedwig were both intrigued by the massage, so they heckled Dom to bring them\nthere.\nAs they arrived, they found out that Dom apparently was banned from the place,\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/sea-hags-the-story-so-far-part-1/","path":"/blog/sea-hags-the-story-so-far-part-1/","title":"Sea Hags: The Story So Far Part 1"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/the-dad-who-left-for-smokes/":{"body":"It's been told in every joke show\nThe dad that left for smokes, bag in tow\nSays to his kids, \"I'll be right back.\"\nThen gone forever, no one to track\n\"Who would do that?\", I used to think\nIt's insane!

Some planes would \nalso not have direct interactions with each other, if not for it.\nI've sort of initially devised a classification for the various planes that have already seen some screen time here.\nThere are some guidelines that I'm trying to put into place in this world. That gods aren't omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient beings. Their powers don't really directly empower the divine magic users. The planes where these gods reside might be sources of magic, but they aren't really a plane of these demiurges that forged the multiverse.\nThe nature of these beings and their planes of origin would inform the plane's classification.\nThese were the classifications I thought would fit:\n\nMaterial\nIdeal\nChaotic\n\nMaterial Planes would be those that are like Thera. A world reminiscent of the real world, where things follow a somewhat logical causality.\nIdeal Planes would be idealized worlds where philosophies, or entities of the mind take some life of their own, like the Feywild or the Elemental Planes.\nChaotic Planes, where matter cannot be formed. A place of raw energies.\nThese planes would exist in some kind of spectrum, where an actual plane is classified based on where in that spectrum it is placed. \nThen I had these concepts of sources and sinks--certain planes in which magic either came from, or drain towards, respectively. The thought is that magical flow between these sources and sinks is what gives Material Planes, like Thera, their magic. The original concept is that Ideal Planes are sources, and that Chaotic Planes are sinks.\nSo how do these planes come together to form what we see in the present-day campaign?\nThe thought currently, is that these planes' influence on the world wax and wane with a somewhat regular periodicity. Travel between the plane and Thera would be much easier, the closer it is to an \"influence maximum\". Conversely, more difficult during an \"influence minimum\". If that plane is a source, then more magic flows into Thera during an increasing period, then the magic wanes during a decreasing period. If a plane is a sink, then the opposite is true.\n\nNow, since many of these planes are connected to Thera, depending on their varying periodicity, there would be times of magical maximums or magical minimums. So, I am thinking, that these current events indicate that the world is coming into a maximum. This means that the cause of the return of magic into the world not only coincides with the ease in which planar travel may happen, but is also the cause of it.\nThe problem that remains now, are the motivations of some of the planar travellers in attempting to take Thera. In-game, I've already established that for some reason, aberrations from the Far Realms were for some reason trying to get into Thera. Now, I do have something of a framework to explain their motivations. In my head it makes some sense that the Far Realm is a Material Plane as well, but one that is closer to being a Chaotic plane in the spectrum. This means that the plane is at the risk of unravelling all the time. So it's an existential one. \nIn my conception, the Far Realms are a magical sink, where many other Material Planes leech their magical energy into. So they depend upon other planes and their connection to them to ensure that they remain stable enough to exist. \nSince the creatures from the Far Realms are almost universally considered evil, if the culture is knowledgeable enough, they will attempt to sever the connection with it. This would explain the Deathengel's actions in a previous adventure. I think that the Angels of the Celestial Plane of Justice, woul have put it upon themselves to enter nearby planes in order to stop the advance of the aberrations.\nCurrently, I think these magical maxima have about 5 cycles, with different planes interacting during each of them (I'd like to eventually math this out), but the one approaching only happens once every 30,000 years or so. It's one that connects the Far Realms to Thera during a time when many other mostly-Ideal Planes intersect.\nIt begins with a connection with the Feywild, which only synchronizes strongly with Thera in 30,000-year cycles. Which is why, even if there are long-lived races there, what they call Fey Crossings are basically unknown by all but a few specialized scholars. The Kurerans, as they were called by the Kalassarians, were gnomes that have entered Thera through an unusually large-scale crossing.\nTheir knowledge of alchemy allowed them to thrive, even in the relatively low level of magical energy when they arrived in about 10,000 PF. Small pockets of elves, dwarves, etcetera came along during that time as well.\nAbout 8000-7000 PF, a connection with the Far Realms was discovered. I haven't decided which side yet. But this is what bootstraps all the present events. I also haven't decided on the cycle length for these are.\nAbout the same time, the Celestial and Infernal Planes began synchronizing. I think these cycles are spaced somewhat closer than the Fey Cycle. Probably 9000 year cycles? I am kind of leaning towards a lack of direct connection with the Abyss. They only connect via both Infernus and the Far Realms, and maybe through the Feywild (but only if the connection is re-established).\nElemental planes must be connected as well. I think most Material planes are connected to those. But in particular, we have already established warlocks of the Djinn (Ruomei and Yayoi).\n30,000 years seems kind of short though? If it's like this, this might have affected Theran development during sometime after an analogue to the Neolithic Revolution.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/theorycrafting-planes/","path":"/blog/theorycrafting-planes/","title":"Theorycrafting: Planes"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/tower-built-from-pain/":{"body":"Measured to precision\nPicking up each block\nDone with indecision\nOn each drop, a pock\nLayered with derision\nConstructed with elision\nWith bone as a foundation\nGround skulls to paste for adhesion\nErecting a bold piece\nThe tower these words mold\nFloors riddled with disease\nShaped by grief as scaffold\nA monumental masterpiece\nCreated to perfection\nYet underneath, behind the grease\nA painful connotation\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/tower-built-from-pain/","path":"/blog/tower-built-from-pain/","title":"Tower Built from Pain"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/campaign-prep/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/campaign-prep/","path":"/campaign-prep/","title":"Campaign Prep"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/campaign-prep/phantasmagoria/":{"body":"Hugo\nEven though the group has access to spells like \n\nteleport nowadays, the most reliable and economical way to get to Phantasmagoria would be to go through the Walburton Doorway that connects the Turbiere de Hubar with the Walburton Mansion.

His poor health had\nforced his parents to homeschool the child, hiring a number of different tutors depending on his need.\nBy all accounts, he was a fantastic student, with his tutors often impressed with the amount of progress\nhe made, especially in his language subjects. He had special interest in history, however, and was often\ninterested in the unfolding of history and how people played their roles in shaping it.\nWhen he turned 16, one tutor had shown him that recent developments in historiography had made it clear\nthat traditional histories often left out how ethnic groups and their peculiarities have shaped how such\nevents unfolded, and thus began his overwhelming interest in Anthropology.\nUniversity🔗\nHis first years in the University of Mayonne were difficult for young Andre. He was not used to social interaction\ndue to his sheltered and secluded childhood. Even though is health was much better at this point than it was in his\nyounger days, he often faced bullying from some of his peers because of how much smaller and thinner he was than the average.\nHe used the experience to publish his own work though, called A Study of the Dynamic of the Body Academic (sometimes\nshortened to Body Academic), which was a personal effort to make sense of the first two years of his university life. \nThe negative portrayal of certain sections of the student body and the faculty had caused derision in many cases, \nbut the quality of the work had also brought admiration to many.\nUoM's College of Anthropology had chosen to accelerate his career by including him in various field studies of indigenous\ngroups. He was brought in as an intern in a joint study in the grammar and evolution of the \nBaraonian Language.\nThe Cannibal moniker🔗\nFollowing the publication of Body Academic, Arquette was called out by a fellow named Marcus Pillorante for allegedly describing\nan individual who shared some of his distinct features, and equating him to a monkey-in-heat. Lacking much physical strength in\nhis arms, when it came to blows, he chose to defend himself by using his teeth. He bit off Pillorante's ear, and in some accounts,\nhe chewed on the piece and swallowed. The event quickly frightened Pillorante, who was rushed to a nearby clinic.\nPillorante brought the matter up to the Office of the Rector, but the case was dismissed due to overwhelming evidence that he had\ninstigated the fight. Pillorante was quite popular though, and many of his friends began referring to Arquette as the Campus Cannibal.\nDiscovery and Mission to Moreaux Island🔗\nIn 1269 AI, Arquette joined an expedition to document the various ethnic sub-groups in and around the islands of L'Illes Apgarie.\nReports of a subset of ethnically Estregan people have thrived, even on some of the smallest islets and platorms in the area, and have\nsurvived by providing services to pirates and privateers who used the waters around the islands to dodge Seneran Navy patrols.\nTheir expedition was cut short, however, when they were caught in between a confrontation between the Senerans and a vessel bearing the \nBouillard family crest. Their ship survived the damage they had received, but they were forced to land on an uncharted\nisland surrounded by mangroves. The island, to their surprise, was populated by a number of people who spoke a language similar to the \nEstregan Language.\nBy general consensus by the survivors, they dedicated the island to the voyage's deceased captain, Marvin Moreaux when\nthey publish their reports on it. The natives called themselves the Mundaguk, meaning \"Men at the edge of the world\". The Mundaguk practiced a\nform of gerontophagic ritual cannibalism.\nThe ritual is undergone when an individual member of the community reaches a certain age, and is without obvious signs of disease. First the island shamans prepare a\ncertain mushroom, called the Moreaux mushroom by the survivors, to be consumed by the family members of said individual. This mushroom somehow\nstimulates the senses of the person's family, that they are able to consume the person in their entirety, completely raw.\nShortly after their return to Mayonne, Arquette wrote and published Monsters of Moreaux Island. The book so fascinated the people of Apgar, that a number\nof plays and songs were made, inspired by the source material. They took many liberties, however, which led to the popular misconception of Mundaguk cannibalism.\nAddiction to the Moreaux Mushroom🔗\nAndre Arquette took a number of raw Moreaux Mushrooms to Mayonne with him, with the intention of further research on its effects. Upon his return however,\nhe was beset by curiosity, and decided to eat one raw. Its effects were immediate. His muscles bulged to unbelievable proportions, and his appetite for\nhuman flesh was uncontrollable. He destroyed the door to his dorm room and ran to the nearest scent of human. Coincidentally, he encountered Marcus Pillorante.\nIn the morning, Arquette was found in Pillorante's room, lying next to his victim's almost completely consumed body. Only the man's head and extremities\nwere uneaten.\nAttempts were made to hide the incident, but eventually the University of Mayonne was forced to dismiss him from his professorship. Arquette still had a number\nof mushrooms in his possession though. The fact that his first victim was a man that persecuted him for most of his public life had emboldened him to\ntry it more, believing that he could direct his Moreaux Monster to be a force for good.\nA play called Cowl of the Moonlight was in the works based on the Moreaux Monster and his exploits. This had brought the\nattention of Paula Abdul to him, right as he was running out of the mushroom, and suffering withdrawal as he rationed them.\nShe offered to find him more mushrooms in return of doing errands for her.

Born in a homestead in the\nnorth-western reaches of Carmar, his\nidentity as a Cornups had always branded him as an\noutcast, but as he'd found himself with the crew of the Rozenmaiden, he'd\nfinally begin to understand what it meant to be comfortable with himself and\nothers.\nHistory🔗\nEarly Life🔗\nHe did not remember much about his mother and father, not even their names\nremained fresh in his mind. All he remembered from his early childhood was that\nhe had slowly manifested features that were considered \"devilish\". By age three,\na small nub at the end of his spine began to form into a tail. When he turned\nfive, little horns began to sprout from the sides of his forehead. His parents,\nbeing a part of a very superstitious community, tried all they could to hide his\npeculiarities from the rest of the town.\nAt the time, Cotto's tail was barely an inch long, so it was easily hidden by\nwearing a pair of tight underwear. However, his growing horns was not that easy\nto hide. At first, his parents kept his hair long enough to conceal the\ncalcified bumps that formed, but in only a few months after, it began to poke\nthrough. His father, one night had his mother hold him down as he rasped the\nlittle horns flat. That first time was very traumatic to the young Cotto,\nmentioning that he'd still sometimes have visceral nightmares of his father and\nthe head-splitting sensation that rattled his head until he'd pass out, not even\nable to wail, since his mother would stuff his mouth with a cloth gag.\nBy the time he'd turned seven, his skin would slowly turn in to a leathery red\nthat could no longer be hidden, or filed away. He was kept in the house, never\nto leave. A kindly old man would come to teach him how to read and write. He\nleft him some books to read, and some ink and paper to practice writing with.\nThe next year, he'd fall in to a terrible fever that caused his legs to swell\nand decay. The kindly old man, being a healer, did what he can to suppress the\nsymptoms, but to no avail. All he could do to prevent necrosis from spreading to\nthe rest of his body, was to amputate his left leg.\nDuring the autumn harvest in the homestead, it was discovered that the crop had\nsuffered intense frost, rotting a large portion before it could be sold. Cotto's\nfather started to believe that this was a punishment from the Angel of Nature\nfor nurturing the unnatural Cotto. At this point his father wanted nothing to do\nwith the boy, but did nothave the heart to kill him himself, so he decided to\nbring Cotto to the southern border, near the freeholds to be sold to some\nslavers. It was during this journey that Cotto escaped his father and ran into\nthe [Faustine Forest] bordering Carmar and Sartoria.\nMephistophelian Pact🔗\nCold and alone, Cotto tried to find his way out of the forest, with little\nsuccess. His attempts to catch small prey, such as rabbits, were unsuccessful.\nCotto was able to find shelter in a small cave formed under the roots of a\nmassive maple tree, called the Mother Maple by local woodsmen. The sweet sap\nfrom the maple was barely able to sustain him. The harsh Carmarian winter of\n1167 brought the poor boy to the brink of death.\nUnable to move and delirious from hunger, Cotto started to hear a voice\ncompelling him to crawl deeper into the small cave. He began to crawl in his\nenfeebled state until he found himself in front of a frozen throne. A man,\nprobably 14 feet tall sat imperiously upon the throne, his face concealed by a\nshroud of darkness. Within his mind, the red-skinned man who introduced himself\nas Erasmus offered Cotto a deal. Cotto would be given the power to survive on\nhis own if he would agree to serve his master. In desperation, the child agreed\nto the deal, making him a warlock of the mysterious Mephistopheles.\nHe would awaken in the morning, under the small nook underneath the Mother\nMaple, with no sign of the crawlspace that had led him to Erasmus' throne. As he\nemerged from the cave, he was no longer affected by the cold of the winter air.\nHis hunger was gone, and he was able to move around freely. Eventually he made\nhis way out of the forest, guided by a silent voice into a small parochial\nBaraonian village.\nFollowers of the Goat🔗\nIn the two years since he was lost in the forest, Cotto had tried to find any\ninformation about his true nature, and that of his pact-holder. Though the voice\nin his head taught him to survive, they would not answer any direct questions\nregarding their identity.

She lived a sheltered life surrounded by servants and minders, her every move and activity carefully planned out by her tutors. For even at a young age, she had always been driven to meet her father's often unrealistic expectations--a small mistake would make her father mutter audibly in her presence, \"I should have had a son.\"\nHer lessons often started and ended with the story of the rise, fall and recovery of the Dubois family--how their ancestors have struggled to rise into the aristocracy from the fringes of Sanerian society; how there were elements always acting to undermine their authority and power due to petty jealousy and greed; how hubris almost broke the family during the First Apgarian Revolution.\nBecause of her upbringing, however, she had never really had a taste of real life until she left her home to enter the University of Sanery in 1267. She suddenly found herself with a great deal more freedom to explore the world around her as she left her home. She went to taverns and bars, watched brawls and went into brothers. Most of these new experiences were due to the influence and charisma of her cousin Antoinette Dubois.\nThese new experiences and her education in the liberal and political arts had developed within her new feminist ideas. Ideas from feminist thinkers like Sapphia of Lesivos and Karamala of Calamutz.Further readings have led her back to the folklore from her homeland's island chain L'Illes Apgarie. In particular, stories surrounding the cults surrounding the Hags.\nIn her youth, she was told to dismiss the tales of the Hags of Hama as myth and heresy. A proper Masochistic woman should not believe in things such as magic. it isn't real--the Church itself says so. They are temptation by the adversary to lure you away from proper supplication to the Lord. So, as she had found herself free from the constraints of her conservative family, she was able to take a keener interest into the Hags, and what they represented. To her though. their magic was not what they could conjure from the void--it was the empowerment they gave each other as part of a collective. She took this as a model for the feminist commune she had formed with a number of her compatriots. They called themselves the Hags Congenial of Sanery. The fact that colloquially, prostitutes in brothels are also called hags was a huge part in choosing the name, as protecting the rights of sex workers was included in their agenda.\nAt the time, Denise Dubois was not a very charismatic public speaker. She had grand ideas, sure, but she'd always volunteered her work to the women she saw as her social betters--one of them was her dear cousin Antoinette. Denise had come up with the ideas, and Antoinette became the spokesperson. So most of Denise's accomplishments in the Hags Congenial were naturally attributed to the more gifted orator and natural beauty. Antoinette would deny accolades, of course, and would often refer them to her brilliant cousin from the Islands, but few believed it.\nEven as she returned to Raibon, she retained this meekness that she'd had. She often attempted to avoid social events to explore more about the island she was taught to disdain. Eventually she met with some women searching for the Deep Lore. Her fascination with the topic, and the shared philosophy that these women peddled resonated with her, and so she had joined them. These women taught her their ways, which would result in a boost in her self-esteem and confidence. Enough to be able to speak with more expressiveness and passion.The group had eventually called themselves the Hags of Hama after those who were said to have had access to the Deep Lore in the past.\nIn a year, she felt she was ready to push her ideas into the public sphere again. This time, she would try her hand at politics.\nShe grew her support base by inviting more women to meet with the Hags of Hama. They were taught feminist ideas and also ideas that the women that comprised these new Hags of Hama believed. Then these recruits would spread the ideas along with her name and her intent to run for office.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/denise-dubois/","path":"/characters/denise-dubois/","title":"Denise Dubois"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/dermot-mulroney/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/dermot-mulroney/","path":"/characters/dermot-mulroney/","title":"Dermot Mulroney"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/desmond-darling/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/desmond-darling/","path":"/characters/desmond-darling/","title":"Desmond Darling"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/diana-savoy/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/diana-savoy/","path":"/characters/diana-savoy/","title":"Diana Savoy"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/dominguez-tailleur/":{"body":"Dominguez Tailleur is an officer of the La Camaraderie ship, the Rozenmaiden. He currently serves as the ship's quartermaster. Born in the prominent Estregan Port City of Maras to Dauphine Tailleur and Aventador Rodriguez. The Tailleurs were well-known in the city as a family of skilled garment-makers up until the mid 1200s AI. The Apgarian-Poasan Conflict and its aftermath impoverished the city's many artisans and businesses, including the one owned by the Tailleurs. So though Dom was trained as his mother's apprentice, he left to become a sailor, and would later become a member of La Camaraderie.\nEarly Life🔗\nThe first three years of Dom's life, the Tailleur family made military uniforms for the Estregan battalion. The income afforded them some measure of comfort during his early childhood. However as the war reached its climax, the military reallocated funding to munitions and essential supplies that orders of new uniforms shrank significantly. Seneran Naval blockades also shut down major port cities in the western Apgarian coast.\nThe Estregan Port City of Maras, where the Tailleurs resided was one of those most heavily affected by the blockade. It made it near impossible for local weavers to get certain raw materials for garments, such as dyes from Racos Palma, which in turn limited what the Tailleurs could make. The blockade also limited the number of fishing vessels allowed to leave port. Since the people of the coastal city relied heavily on their fishing industry, this led to terrible long-term food shortages. It got so bad, that when Dom was five years old, his then infant younger sister Celeste nearly died due to malnutrition. Luckily, she survived and, as of 1275,  she continued to work in the Tailleurs' shop near the Maras city plaza.\nDuring that time, Dom began his apprenticeship with is mother. At age five, he was given menial tasks, such as fetching spools of thread and helping measure-out the fabric. As he grew, so did his responsibilities. \nAdolescence🔗\nBy the time he was twelve years old, he was already capable of sewing according to his mother's designs. In 1261, many of the shipping restrictions imposed on Apgarian vessels have already lifted, and Dom's father had returned to fishing in order to augment their family's coffers, as Seneran boutiques still dominated the local garments industry.\nOften Dom would need to help his now middle-aged father, especially when the clothes shop wasn't busy. It was at this time that he learned how to sail a single-masted vessel along with a small fishing crew. Of course, his love was still for tailoring and dressmaking, so he preferred to work in his mother's workshop.\nThe following year, the Tailleurs had the opportunity to purchase a shop near the city plaza. Dom noted that a shop window along one of the busiest streets in Maras would be the perfect place to showcase his mother's designs, and that they should take it. After a few days of deliberation, his mother took out a loan from the Apgarian Confederate Bank for the sum of 2,500 gold pieces, which would cover not just the location, it would also afford them better materials for new garments.\nThings seemed to have finally looked better for the Tailleurs. The construction of the new show was going faster than expected, and there seemed to have been some interest from some of the wealthier merchants for his mother's designs. That is, until the shipment of fabrics and dyes were confiscated by the Seneran patrols as suspected contraband. The delays in materials meant delays in the completion of ordered dresses and suits. These led to cancellations of contracts, which meant that the loan they took out couldn't be settled in a timely fashion. The bank seized Dom's childhood home and threatened to repossess the shop as well if they couldn't pay.\nDom then decided that he would find his fortune in the sea. In the dead of night, he sneaked out of their shop, which they also made their home after the bank seized their family house in downtown Maras, and stowed away in a Mirian Trading Co. galley.\nSoon enough, after arriving at Port Rainoso, Dom found gainful employment as a deckhand in the Principium. He sent a majority of his wages to his mother which helped greatly in ensuring that payments for the loan were made.\nSinking of the Principium🔗\nThe Principium was attacked by three Seneran frigates during a transport operation. Dom was manning the rigging at the time, as the ship navigated through the treacherous Sarmatian waters west of Parpelisse. A sudden explosion collapsed the ship's main mast and threw Dom into the sea. Another explosion sunk the ship, killing those who were in the lower decks at the time. Dom, Somme, Jean-Paul, Craçoix and Jethro, among others survived. The Senerans were able to capture members of that crew however.\nJethro, distraught from the loss of his ship, and the fact that he didn't go down with it, retired from La Camaraderie and sailing entirely. Jean-Paul and Somme however, were only emboldened to oppose the Senerans even more. Jean-Paul used his connections as a de la Fouet to purchase a galley from Sanerian dry docks. They would christend the ship La Carnalis, and would invite Dom and other members of Principium first. Dom accepted.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/dominguez-tailleur/","path":"/characters/dominguez-tailleur/","title":"Dominguez Tailleur"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/domino-bentayga/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/domino-bentayga/","path":"/characters/domino-bentayga/","title":"Domino Bentayga"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/don-alejandro-machado/":{"body":"Alejandro Machado is the 4th generation head of the Machado&nbsp;family, and had introduced the distribution of White Powder.

Her parents believed they were blessed to have a child so late in their life after trying for so many years.\nHedwig experienced the best the world had to offer from an early age, introduction and exposure to high society was a part of her life. She was raised as a lady to expect a certain sort of respect from others.\nStolen Child🔗\nEven with all the love and affection she received from her family, Hedwig still feels incomplete. Yearning for something she doesn’t understand, she starts searching for her true origins. She believed she was bought when she was an infant, but no records of such deed have been found. Hedwig paid a person who introduced himself as the Blue Fluffy Unicorn to investigate the “Miracle” her parents always talked about. B.F.U. told her that her parents made a deal with a Hag and Hedwig is the result of such arrangement. \nHedwig spent years studying about occultism to learn more about Hags.

She inherited the hospital from her family and expanded upon its emphasis on the anonymity of its patients, typically pirates and smugglers. Under her stewardship, she introduced a blend of magical and surgical techniques that changed bodily and facial features of her patients to help them hide their identity from authorities.\nHistory🔗\nEarly Years🔗\nBorn in the 12th day of the 7th month of 1185 as the only daughter and heir to parents Gallen Wunderplat and Ermingarde Wunderplat neé von Weinstein. Erminegarde had two prior miscarriages before Iluvia was born, and had almost lost her life during labor. Because of this, she was no longer deemed capable of rearing another child. As such, Iluvia was always poised to take over Wunderplat Hospital from a very young age.\nHer primary education was addressed by her mother who homeschooled her until age 12. Beyond her foundation in reading, writing and arithmetic, she was free to learn on her own, as long as it was within the confines of the Wunderplat estate. In that time, she devoured her father's tomes on medicine, herbology and surgery. Her father would always allow her free rein in their hospital, and would be allowed to observe in various routine procedures. Aside from the hospital and their estate on Racos Palma, however, she was not to leave a chaperone's sight at all times.\nSoon, she would not be satisfied with simply reading theoretical treatises on surgical techniques. She would sneak away from their estate to collect herbs that are said to have anaesthetic effects, and would experiment on small animals, like pets or captured rats. She would then dissect the creatures, then she would to but the parts back together in an attempt to revive them. \nHer curiosity would soon escalate, and she would operate on the son of one of the Wunderplat's servants who complained of a stomachache. She correctly diagnosed that the boy suffered from appendicitis, and then coerced the boy to allow her to operate on him. Initially, the operation seemed to be a success. However, since the operation was done in secret, the boy could not be kept in bedrest, and was forced to be physically active soon after the operation. This caused internal bleeding, and soon led to sepsis, then death. The matter was kept quiet by her family, paying off the servant's family and moved them to a Wunderplat estate in the Freeholds.\nInternship in the Wunderplat Hospital🔗\nIn 1199, at age 14, in an effort to curb their daughter's more morbid curiosities, and to encourage her talent, her father decided to train her as surgical aide. To everyone, the effort seems to have borne fruit. She became more sociable with others, and her curiosity seemed to have been directed into more mainstream medical and surgical procedures. In reality, she just learned to hide her more radical projects better. She used the money that she received as salary from her official duties in the hospital to rent a small shed near Racos Palma's famous Tapestry Hills. There she practiced on her more controversial methods on hapless pirates who were easily tempted by a much cheaper rate, and the allure of the young Iluvia.\nUniverity of Sanery Medical Program🔗\nAs she reached the age of 17, her father had enrolled her at the University of Sanery's Medical Program. During those years, she carefully refined some techniques she learned by herself in her small shed, and melded them with the state-of-the-art that she learned in university. During her training, she learned to be much more meticulous and nuanced in her experimentation--always ensuring that the public eye believed her work to be within the ethical guidelines. Her final thesis, On the Reconstruction of Cartilagenous Material of Lacerated Nasal Passageways was considered groundbreaking and earned her offers of fellowships in various medical institutions around Apgar and abroad. Of all of these, she was drawn to Unibersidad de la Gonzales, a teaching hospital in Mehicania under the tutelage of one of its founders, Paz Gonzales, one of the pioneers of the field of reconstructive surgery. Many tried to dissuade her from studying under the man, citing a history of questionable ethics, which, to Iluvia, was one of his most attractive traits. She believed that she would be allowed to further her research without having to constrain herself with problems of ethics, as she had when she was working in her little shed near the dye workshops in the Tapestry Hiils.\nApprenticeship in the Unibersidad de la Gonzales🔗\nAs soon as she graduated and received her Apgarian Medical and Surgical licenses in 1207, Iluvia took a sea voyage to Mehicania's Tordesillas region in order to begin her apprenticeship to Señor Gonzales. There, she was able to develop new techniques in facial reconstruction. She and Paz perfected a practical technique for nasal reconstruction, which was the subject of her doctorate thesis. They went on to jawline modification and earlobe reconstruction.  One particular matter of some obsession for her during her residency, was her failed research into iris pigmentation and attempts at permanently altering them.\nMuch of their work, however, was marred with controversy, following accusations of grave robbery and illegal coercion to gather test subjects. The institution was shielded, however by the Mehicanian [Ejercito del Tierro], which had sought out their surgical techniques to disguise their spies, which were deployed against insurgents of the Hermanos de la Libertad and their rumored agitators backed by the Apgarian Army.\nReturn to Wunderplat Hospital🔗\nIn 1216, nine years after her arrival at Mehicania, Iluvia's father contracted a strange illness that attacked his liver. Her mother regularly sent her updates about her father's declining condition. It seemed that physicians at the Wunderplat Hospital, as well as specialists from Sanery were not able to diagnose the source of the illness and were only treating the symptoms. While this eased his condition somewhat, his health was still deteriorating at a rapid pace. Before the year's end, Iluvia asked for permission to see to her father's health. Señor Gonzales not only allowed it, but declared that she is free of his apprenticeship, and can be considered a master in her own right.\nBy the time that she had arrived in Racos Palma, her father was already in the late stages of his illness, which was declared a form of cancer that seemed to have unusual properties. Despite her efforts, her father died in the first week of 1218, nearly two years after he started showing symptoms. This disease became her new obsession. She tried to find people with similar symptoms and a similar progression, using Wunderplat's many contacts in the criminal underworld of Apgar and Senera. She also made use of resources she'd gathered over the years in the Mehicanian military. She found nine subjects that she researched extensively for the next seven years of her life.\nIllness and the Occult🔗\nAlong with scientific research, her fruitless efforts had brought her into the realm of the occult and the study of Old Kalassarian texts on alchemical medicine. This had led her to a group of people who claimed to study the Ritma--a lost art practiced by the Kalassarians during the Empire's Age of Bloom. They called themselves the Phantasmagoria. They claimed to have access to documents and records sealed by the Divine Masochist Primacy of Bastion that might allow her not only to cure the ailment that afflicted her father, but might even grant her the ability to revive him.\nInitially, she was dismissive of Phantasmagoria's claims, but her desperation in solving the problem had brought her to the Alsatian Mountains, where she was told to meet one of Phantasmagoria's higher ranking members. In 1223, she arrived at Karst Fortress, a long forgotten castle a couple of miles away from the town of Mont Alys, high in the Alsatian permafrost.\nIn Karst Fortress, she met with one of the founders of Phantasmagoria. A man who donned the clerical robes of the Society of Nature and claimed himself to be a vampire. Styling himself as the Marquis of Karst, he convinced Iluvia of the veracity of his claims by allowing her to cut his hand off. After 24 hours, he takes the severed hand and reattaches it back to his arm without any surgery--he merely placed the hand back, and it seemed to have stitched itself onto his arm without intervention.\nHe told her that Phantasmagoria was formed in order to, in part, replicate the kind of longevity he had, as well as revive the Kalassarian art of Ritma. That he saw her research about her father's ailment, and believed that she could be instrumental in its return.\nThe Nature of the Ailment🔗\nBy 1224, Iluvia herself had translated complex medical treatises that seemed to point to clues about her father's illness. In fact, she also found that children whose parents perished from the same disease had similar nodules in their liver, but did not suffer from the same fate. In 1225, her research had led her to the conclusion that people with such livers made them capable of using Ritma somehow, but did not know the mechanism to do so. \nShe would travel back to Racos Palma to attend to her mother's funeral who died of natural causes. During her absence in Karst Fortress, one of the members of Phantasmagoria, Souveran Rothschild returned from an expedition to Ahuria carrying a purple-black orb, claiming not to know of its significance, but he had taken it from a strange creature who tried to rob his caravan.\nUpon her return to Karst Fortress, the Marquis mentioned the object in passing, saying that the blood of the person who brought it to him seemed especially appetizing. As she touched the strange object, she immediately burst forth with energy that blew out all the candles within a 30 foot radius. Afterwards the orb's purple hue faded to a deep black, losing its previous luster. This seemed to be the catalyst that they needed to use Ritma. Of particular note to Iluvia due to her previous research, her eye color changed from a pale blue to a golden yellow.\nThe Marquis called for a Conclave, calling for the upper echelon of the Phantasmagoria to Karst. They were shown the strange orb, and were tasked to find information about them.\nReturn to Racos Palma🔗\nInformation on sources of these orbs, thus any kind of research into them were slow, but since the Fall of Bastion, rumors of people from the east performing feats only recorded in fairy tales and discredited history books. Eventually, Iluvia was able to replicate a spell called thunderwave from an ancient spellbook. She theorized, incorrectly, that since she had come in contact with the orb, she became able to draw upon the elements. It was much later that news of the Fall of Bastion reached Karst Fortress, including the orb that gradually consumed the Burtian capital, and the connection to the reappearance of magic was made.\nBy then, Illuvia decided that her time would be better served back in Racos Palma, where she would be able to do research on her own, with the resources at her disposal there. The loose association that Phantasmagoria provided, she deemed unreliable as a source of consistent information, especially as the Marquis himself frequently travelled away from Karst Fortress. She took many spellbooks and grimoires when she left in the spring of 1228.\nDuring her absence, Wunderplat Hospital continued to provide medical and surgical services to smugglers and pirates using the same operating procedures her parents have extolled. Corruption by some of the managerial staff she left behind, however, had dwindled the hospital's coffers and left many of the facilities in disrepair.\nWhen she saw the state of the hospital upon her return, she was furious. Managerial staff rumored to be behind Wunderplat Hospital's rapid decline disappeared, their bodies found flayed and disemboweled in the Mermaid Forest a month later. Apgarian naval officers were tasked to investigate this matter, along with Iluvia's potential connection to the Mehicanian military, but no evidence was found implicating her to the matter. A mute deckhand from a Mehicanian schooner was soon found to be the culprit and was beheaded for the crime.\nShe had made connections with Sanerian finacier Louis Vega in an effort to refinance the hospital, mortgaging family holdings in the Freeholds of Tamar and Rigatona. Within a year, Wunderplat Hospital saw an expansion of its facilities, including her purchase and rehabilitation of the Racos Palma Lighthouse.\nFor the next twenty years, she had grown in her ability to cast magic, and her understanding of some of its fundamentals.

Often considered the kindest of the four, many of those who have some troubled history with the other three flee to her and her protection. Local Divine Masochists who dislike the Machados also choose to live in her territory because of her more tolerant attitude to them, despite her adherence to the local form of paganism she espouses.\nHer family was one of the wealthiest of those that were truly native to the island. She often cites how her maternal line have been on the island long before the first Estregans even laid eyes on it. As such, she is very familiar with many of the traditions and lore unique to the Island.\nShe was born on the 22nd day of the 5th month 1192 in their sugar plantation in Guarma--a small island in L'Illes Apgarie. Her mother died in childbirth for reasons unknown. Her brother, Bellamy Coutillie was from her father's second wife, who had treated Clarita coldly, up until she had succumb to Cholera immediately after her own son's death in 1204.\nFamily History🔗\nThe Coutillie family's wealth is attributed to their successful leadership during the slave revolts during the Second Apgarian Revolution. Her forebears were able to negotiate a deal with the Estregan Royal House to quell tensions in exchange for the position of Viceroy of Raibon, which also bestows the title of marquis. History credits this move as what eventually allows the Estregans to focus on the revolutionaries in their realm, which in turn gives the other nearby kingdoms to slowly regain lost ground.\nClarita's father, Aloysius Coutillie, used their wealth to finance small market vendors in need of capital. This made him a beloved personality in Port Rainoso, but especially in the East Side where they reside. Louis, as he was called, accepted chattel as collateral for small-interest loans. A large number of those loans&nbsp;were often left unpaid due to a mix of wide-spread financial issues at the time, and Louis' soft-handed approach to collection. A large portion of their once enormous fortune disappeared in a couple of decades.&nbsp;\nClarita at age 24--3 years before her father died--started to reassess and restructure their collection methods. For the most part, she did not increase the interest rates for those who settled their debts in a reasonable time frame. She had even given her collectors to be more lenient to people who lapsed for up to 2 months, if they had a good payment history. The more delinquent of their borrowers on the other hand, were not so lucky. She hired large and intimidating men to escort her female collectors to threaten, torture or, in some extreme cases, amputate them, depending on the size of the loan and the difficulty of collection.\nBy the time she had gained complete control of the family estates, she had, through her acquisitions, owned a number of small businesses with various levels of legality, including eateries, bath houses, gambling houses, brothels and drug stores.\nIn her 50s, Clarita had, with the help of the Bouillards&nbsp;and the Port Rainoso Local Government started a housing redevelopment project to address the ever-growing population within the East Side. This saw many of the shanties in the area give way to more modern 3-storey apartments. The project began with purchasing large tracts of privately-held land within her sphere of control. Those that sold their lands at the rate Clarita had dictated promised that they, and their descendants would have the right to collect rent in these buildings in exchange for a 30% cut of profits.&nbsp;\nRelationship with Yves Renault Bouillard🔗\nWhen Clarita's younger brother, Bellamy Coutillie turned 5 years old, old Estregan tradition dictated that as the eldest son, he would be bequeathed the title of heir apparent. Often, if there was an older daughter, a union was arranged to quell any potential inheritance issues. It was then arranged that Clarita, aged 12 at the time, was to be betrothed to Yves Renault, the Bouillards' second son. The betrothal was not the stuff of romance. Both Clarita and Yves treated the matter as a sterile business-like affair. They were civil, they went to public events together, but there was no love between them. In their teen years, they did cultivate a friendship between them. They made plans to take both families out from the criminal underworld, and away from the traditionalist values that was too close to royalty for the democratic nation of Apgar--if only they would be in positions of power.\nFour years into their betrothal, Bellamy died of Cholera. Shortly after, so does Yves' elder brother Basillios. Now both as the heirs apparent of their respective houses, their betrothal was rescinded. Over the years, their close friendship had remained, with a close correspondence maintained between them, and Yves' wife Nicolette up until Yves' death during the Poasan-Apgarian Conflict in 1255\nFeud with the Machados🔗\nThe Machado family only been in Raibon Island since the late-1100s, barely 3 generations when Clarita had come to power. She had learned to distrust the family, along with some of the Mehicanian republicans that had taken refuge in the island from the people around her. In particular, Yves had always thought that the Machados' wont for pomp and pageantry had flagged them as secret royalists. Correspondence from Yves during the 5 year war&nbsp;had, more than once, accused the new head of the Machado house,&nbsp;Don Alejandro Machado, as a spy for the Mehicanian military.\nEven though none of the accusations of espionage been proven, Clarita never did fully trust the Machado family--especially when they started selling Powder of the Poppy in the East Side. She had often cooperated with government crackdowns on the opiates, even allowing the various task forces to establish bases of operations at the border of their territory.&nbsp;\nOral Tradition🔗\nAs was tradition, the Coutillie women were taught to memorize by heart many of the traditions and stories of the island. Stories of the formation of the Turbiere de Hubar, the creation of the Frogmen and their purpose, and most importantly, the protectors of the island, and its women, the Hags of Hama.\nOne such story, the birth of the Frogmen, was said to have been related to the treasure that the Hags protected above all else--the Deep Lore. \nThe Frogmen were said to have been once the dead of the island. In those days, the people of the island buried their dead in the inner pools of the bog. The Hags asked the people to allow them to raise these bodies so they may protect them from interlopers. When the people agreed, the Hags had chosen to hide their faces to spare the citizens of the pain that may be caused by seeing their loved ones have no recognition of who they were. They took inspiration from the many frogs in the bog, which could breathe both on land and in water. Thus the Frogmen were born.\nShe also speaks about Frogmen such as Godfrey who were turned before death. They were often evil people whose deeds were so terrible, they must remember what they have done to deserve their fate. She mentions that the \"dead are turned into frogmen so the people remember them for who they were, the living are turned into frogmen so that people are remembered them as the monsters they have become.\"\nHexbloods were also in many of her tales. She speaks of how the Hags had the capacity to give or take away ones ability to create life. They were able to grant the barren the ability to conceive, but they can also take it away if you offend them in any way.\nNana Clarita and the other natives believe that they are the descendants of the Goddess of Nature Herself. This, to them, explains their access to the Deep Lore, and the other mysteries that are associated with them. In fact, in the East Side of Rainoso, there is a mystery cult that is dedicated to the true Hags of Hama. These people are offended by the existence of the Reformist Hags, and would actively work against anyone associated with them, such as, perhaps, Denise Dubois.\nThey tolerate the Orthodox due to their belief in the Angels. They find them foolish, however, for their denial of magic.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/nana-clarita-coutillie/","path":"/characters/nana-clarita-coutillie/","title":"Nana Clarita Coutillie"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/nancy-kincade/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/nancy-kincade/","path":"/characters/nancy-kincade/","title":"Nancy Kincade"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/naomi-bentayga/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/naomi-bentayga/","path":"/characters/naomi-bentayga/","title":"Naomi Bentayga"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/narmaya/":{"body":"\n  Warning\nThis article is a stub!

He brought a number of high profile clients into the institution, and is considered one of the top-performing members of the organization. He is also an observer in Tressemer's Council of the Coin, a trade collective formed in order to rival the resources of the Mirian Trading Company.\nEarly Life🔗\nTaurus was born in a shanty in the east side of Port Tressemer in Raibon Island as one of many children of Martha Balimbano. They were destitute, with their mother working a number of jobs in order to keep them fed and clothed. Taurus often went with his mother to her various jobs, including at the Pussy Foot, a low-end brothel a few blocks away from their home. While waiting for his mother there, he taught himself how to read and write from the magazines that are lent to the patrons, and questions from some of the other workers at the establishment.\nHe was never formally schooled until he came to impress a professor who worked at the Tressemer Academy at the age of 12. He was given a full scholarship, free room and board in the campus dormitories, and a sizeable stipend that he used to help his mother and his siblings. For the first 2 years, he was required to take courses to cement a foundation of knowledge before he was asked to select a major. He chose to pursue Economics, optimistic that given enough knowledge, there must be a way to ensure that the poor of Tressemer could be raised up from poverty. By the age of 18, he set out to work in Sanery as an intern to the State Minister of Finance at the Sanerian capital Flouimarie.\nAssistant to the Sanerian Finance Minister🔗\nIn 1239, within a year of his internship, Balimbano was chosen to run errands for the Assistant to the Sanerian Finance Minister at the time, Minister Louis Vega. Balimbano made note of the various appointments, special events and obligations the Minister had, separately from the Assistant meticulously, but also secretly, while he performed his own tasks. Being a self-professed auto-didact, though his direct superior seemed to hamper all his efforts to progress, he learned by observation and trial and error on how to do the job more efficiently and accurately. Before the year was over Balimbano saw his opportunity. His superior lost minutes to an important meeting with the Grand Merchant of the Bank of Sanery. He presented a well-organized and annotated set of minutes, marked for what he thought would be of particular note. His superior was promptly fired, and he was hired permanently for the position.\nDuring the tenure of Louis Vega which lasted until 1247 when he retired, Taurus Balimbano served has his assistant. He had been instrumental in the research for a number of banking reforms that Louis Vega had proposed to the Sanerian Assembly, most notably the easing of some anti-usury statutes that were seen as a detriment to the growth of the fledgeling banking sector.\nHis experience in the Sanerian Finance Ministry was ultimately disillusioning for Taurus. Though well-meaning, many of Vega's policy decisions were mostly directed towards the merchant community, rather than addressing any of his proposals on low interest loans for lower brackets of society. He was often taught that the only real way to help the lower classes is to bolster the merchant class, so they might employ more people. He was often told that the poor did not know how to handle money responsibly, and so banks would have to take in the additional risk, with little reward. Low interest rates for small-value loans would translate to minimum returns, event if they were not delinquent. The projected income would not cover the costs for non-paying clients, and \"recovery\" operations.\nBank of Sanery🔗\nThough he was offered a more permanent staffing position in the Finance Ministry, Balimbano no longer had the same drive to work in, and the confidence to enact change in, government. Instead, he would take on a job offer in the Bank of Sanery in 1248. He was assigned in the Loans Department where he would remain until the Seneran Invasion of Sanery.\nNotable Clients🔗\nIluvia Wunderplat\nRosemunda Parvèse\nConroy Sinclair\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/taurus-balimbano/","path":"/characters/taurus-balimbano/","title":"Taurus Balimbano"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/tedora-mcfarland/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/tedora-mcfarland/","path":"/characters/tedora-mcfarland/","title":"Tedora McFarland"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/thaddeus-savoy/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/thaddeus-savoy/","path":"/characters/thaddeus-savoy/","title":"Thaddeus Savoy"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/characters/tharja-lutgard/":{"body":"\n  Warning\nThis article is a stub!

The uncharted island was surrounded by a mangrove forest and, to their surprise, was populated by a number of people who spoke a language similar to the \nEstregan Language.\nBy general consensus by the survivors, they dedicated the island to the voyage's deceased captain, Marvin Moreaux when\nthey publish their reports on it. The natives called themselves the Mundaguk, meaning \"Men at the edge of the world\". The Mundaguk practiced a\nform of gerontophagic ritual cannibalism.\nRitual Cannibalism🔗\nContrary to popular belief, the Mundaguk people did not mindlessly prey on other humans. Such a practice would have been a detriment to the survival of their\nalready small population. Instead, they perform a ritual sacrifice of older individuals in the community. After a certain age, or if one is proven to be mentally-\ninfirm, a person undergoes a month-long ritual cleansing, by bathing in water boiled with a variety of medicinal herbs and flowers.\nThen, once the preparation of the body is complete, the island shamans prepare a certain mushroom, called the Moreaux mushroom in Arquette's book, to dilute its potent\netfects. The brew is given to the sacrifice's family, which would stimulate their senses and hunger. The mushroom has the unusual effect of making human flesh, not just\npalatable when consumed, but makes it downright irresistable. The sacrifice's throat is then sliced. Before the person even succumbs to death, their relatives proceed to\nconsume their flesh.\nOften the effect wears off after the meal, as the medicinal bath contains some of the antidote to the mushroom, but if the preparation of either the body. or the brew\nwas incorrect, there could be a chance of something going horribly wrong.\nSeclusion🔗\nPerhaps due to the fact that the survivors of the shipwreck took many of the Mundaguk people's cultural items, as well as stocks of the Moreaux mushroom, they\nhave shown aggression towards any who may attempt to land upon their shores. However, there were some reports of Moreaux mushroom being sold in the Apgarian black market.\nEither a group of people have secretly established an exclusive deal with the people, or they may have been able to cultivate it elsewhere.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/ethnicities/mundaguk/","path":"/ethnicities/mundaguk/","title":"Mundaguk"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/ethnicities/parpelissian/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/ethnicities/parpelissian/","path":"/ethnicities/parpelissian/","title":"Parpelissian"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/ethnicities/tandoor/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/ethnicities/tandoor/","path":"/ethnicities/tandoor/","title":"Tandoor"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/events/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/events/","path":"/events/","title":"Events"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/events/ahurian-conquest/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/events/ahurian-conquest/","path":"/events/ahurian-conquest/","title":"Ahurian Conquest"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/events/baraonian-rebellion/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/events/baraonian-rebellion/","path":"/events/baraonian-rebellion/","title":"Baraonian Rebellion"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/events/battles-for-the-masochist/":{"body":"The Battles for the Masochist are a series of campaigns, battles and revolts by Apgarian members of the Church of the Divine Masochist, mostly centered in the Kingdoms of Sanery and Estrega territories, for the cause of religious freedom.\nMany of the Apgarian Kingdoms of the Silent Ages were very hostile to followers of Divine Masochism and the Arzhadadi faith, particularly, due to their strict adherence to a strict monotheism.\nHistory🔗\nConversion of Anasai🔗\nThe Kingdom of Anasai was always a bulwark of the Masochist faith.

Soon the Black Orb would consume the entire city of Bastion, then half the lands of Kalassarian Burtz. Anyone and anything the Orb touched was absorbed into it and was never seen again. People were forced to leave their homes in fear of being swallowed up. Trade routes that wen through Bastion were disrupted since land routes and water ways practically no longer existed.

In this case however, the sale of lands in the Garatonian reserve is prohibited \nby law, and any development must be in coordination with their council of elders.\nThe Garatonian Elders voted unanimously to forbid any mining operations by Voracious, and due to his contempt, barred DeVos from entering Aubergine Garatonie.\nPaula Abdul🔗\nDeVos met Paula Abdul at curtain call at a production of Cowl of the Moonlight.

By the time the case was settled, DeVos had extracted 10 million gold worth of raw material, and had cause massive environmental damage\nfor irresponsible mining practices. Some Garatonians chose to move back into the area, but most were forced to seek opportunities elsewhere, due to the decreased\nproductivity of the reserve.\nAbdul did not expect the reaction to be so violent, but it was effective for DeVos' purposes. She was given a large sum in gold, and a 10% equity in his mining company.\nThe performers she had used reported the matter to the Guildensterns, who had held a meeting to discuss next steps.

It was held in the independent Freehold of Turain, one of the independent city-states south of the Apgarian Confederacy. The 24-day conference was mediated by the Calamutian hosts, and was attended by delegations from the various parties involved with the conflict. Turain was agreed upon as one of the truly neutral entities in close geographical proximity to all the main belligerents.\nConsidered the winners of the conflict, delegates with the Kingdom of Poasah along with delegates from their allied countries, the Kingdoms of Senera and Mehicania demanded the disarmament and immediate surrender of the Apgarian Confederacy and its allies, the Freeholds of Rigatona and Tamar. The Apgarians were expected to expound on certain concessions for their conditional surrender that they delineated in the armistice that led to this conference.\nThe Apharian declaration of the armistice read as follows:\n\nWe of the Council of the Confederation of Apgarian States, for the good of the peoples of\nwhich we have vowed to protect and serve, have agreed to issue a temporary cease on\naggressive military actions against the Kingdoms of Poasah, Mehicania and Senera, \npursuant to a general and lasting peace.

The Fugunots had expressed their wish to remain a part of the Kingdom of Poasah. Additional details listed economic concessions and a transitional period whereby Allied forces retained a presence in Apgarian capitals for a year. \nOne of the most contentious provisions of the treaty was the new role of the Seneran Navy] as Arbiter of the Seas. It established the Senerans as the final word in maritime law and order in the western leg of the Seneran-Apgarian-Posaran trading routes. This was protested by not only the Apgarians, but many of the Freeholds as well. It almost caused a crisis as the various delegations threatened to let the armistice lapse without resolution.

The contiguous Apgarian mainland occupies\nthe western-most portion of the Beteran continent.\nHistorically, the various states that comprise Apgar were once part of the Hapgarian Region of the Kalassarian Empire. Due to the sheer size of the territories, and \nnatural geographical boundaries, the regions have differentiated themselves politically, culturally, and linguistically, since the Fall or the Western Kalassarian Empire and gradually became separate Apgarian states.\nMost of these states transitioned into a feudal form of government, with the exceptions of Baraon and Parpelisse. Baraon formed a pseudo-state from a loose association of communes that have banded together in mutual defense against neighboring monarchists. Parpelisse on the other hand formed a proto-democratic state, where electors from the various guilds elected an executive council to run the territories.\nBy the time of the Second Anasaian-Estregan War in the latter half of the 10th century AI, democractic, liberal and anarchist philosophies began to spread into the monarchist lands. A number of small-scale revolts modeled after the Baraonian Rebellion centuries prior started cropping up in some of the most authoritarian of regimes in the Apgarian region.

Agrarian settlements have been discovered in present-day Mayonne that are currently thought to be from 10,000 PF. \nRecent discoveries of ruins thought to be from the mysterious Kurerans found in\nthe Alsatian Mountains may soon uncover new information regarding pre-Kalassarian Apgar, but no firm scholarly conclusions have been made. It is hoped that these ruins may yield documentary evidence, as Kurerans, even as far back as 3000 PF recorded much about their surrounding cultures, as proven by some preliminary discoveries from some Mehicanian sites.\nPre-Kalassarian Polities🔗\n\n  Warning\nThis article is a stub!

Its government is fairly autonomous its supposed administrative region of Sanery due to the special status enshrined in the Treaty of Turain. The Treaty also specifies that the islands and the surrounding waters of L'Ille Apgarie as a demilitarized zone. A consequence of this, along with Raibon's geographical features made its capital, Port Rainoso, an attractive home to a number of official maritime offices, as well as a number of somewhat \"ad hoc\" ones.\nThe strategic importance of the island in north-south maritime trade is the Heimann Sound, which allows easy access of large trade vessels through the Samain River. At the opposite end of the Sound, is the town of Port Tressemer, sometimes considered the second capital of the island.\nHistory🔗\nThe island was once named Mauricia by the Kalassarian Empire when it was settled in the 111 AI. Not many records of Kalassarian administration survived due to the Sinking of the Town of Hama in 910 AI. It is unknown why the Kalassarians were not able to settle the area in and around the Sound. Its strategic advantages were numerous, and would have been a logical choice. However, the land was empty when Rainoso was founded by Estregan explorers under the auspices of King Raibon I of Estrega almost 800 years later.\nHama🔗\nThe Town of Hama was founded on the site the native Hausi called the Tichom. The existence of the town was considered mythological by scholars for years, as remnants of the settlement were never found, but recently discovered Kalassarian records indicate that the Kalassar were granted those lands for a settlement by the native ruling class. The settlement was used as a trade outpost between Kalassarian Hapgaria and Seneria.\nDuring the Fall of the Western Kalassarian Empire, Mauricia, and therefore Hama was forgotten as shipping lanes were disrupted. The town fell into disrepair, but remained settled, increasingly, by local Hausi elites. By the end of the 5th century, the town had become the cultural and religious center of a cult focused on the worship of a version of the goddess Pomona.\nBy the 6th century, trade has somewhat resumed between mainland Betera and the Seneran kingdom that had risen from the ashes of the Kalassar. Hama had been rediscovered, and once more grown in prominsnce. Attempts by Seneran traders to settle upon either ends of the Samain River were heavily opposed by the natives, however ensuring that Hama was the only largely developed area on the island. Reasons on why were conflicting--some cited religious importance, others mention fear of certain political repercussions. But the situation remained until mid to late 10th century AI.\nIt remains a mystery to this day why the town of Hama disappeared, and where exactly it was located, but scholars often cite seismic activity could have been the root cause. Narratives regarding the \"sinking\" have caused many to speculate that the town may be underneath the waters in or around Hama's Tears. Adventurers' attempts to find any indication are unfruitful. Some believe that the town is underneath what is now the Turbiere de Hubar, but the nature of the bog makes it difficult to even begin.\nHausi🔗\nThe Hausi were once the native people of the island. When the island was discovered by Kalassarian explorers, the people were described as \"unsophisticated and barbaric, but capable of performing incredible feats of magic\".\nThey seem to have originally believed in a kind of Animism, wherein each living being was either endowed by a goddess of nature, or are themselves avatars of the goddess. By the time the Kalassarians have settled in the island, those beliefs seem to have evolved to incorporate the Kalassarian pantheon. Each creature was said to be an amalgamation of pieces of the souls of gods. The proportion that an individual contains dictates their nature. A tree. for example is mostly made of the soul of Pomona, and a monkey has equal propotions of Pomona and Volupta, and smaller amounts of Minerva and Justicia. In the 5th century, during the primacy of Hama as a political entity on the island, and the appearance of the group called the Hags of Hama, their beliefs have shifted to the worship of these hags as an embodiment of the will of the gods. After the Sinking of the Town of Hama, the Hausi have lamented its loss, and had become a part of their local lexicon as swear words and curses.\nIn the ensuing years, the Hausi and their descendants have come to ascribe religious and cultural importance to theTurbiere de Hubar. The Hags of Hama themselves were said to have begun to reside in the Bog. Offerings and prayers are directed toward it, in addition to the Hags themselves. Their dead is laid to rest in the waters in and around it. They also place a general reverence upon the site, promulgating a set of legends and stories about the Bog and the Hags of Hama, including the lore surrounding the Frogmen and the Deep Lore.\nLocations🔗\nHeimann Sound🔗\nPort Rainoso🔗\nSee main article for Port Rainoso\nPort Tressemer🔗\nSee main article for Port Tressemer\nLa Tourbiere de Hobar🔗\nMontrabar🔗\nPapa Simbal's Hut🔗\nLe Phare Phallique🔗\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/locations/raibon-island/","path":"/locations/raibon-island/","title":"Raibon Island"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/locations/ralaka/":{"body":"Ralaka🔗\n\n\n  \n\nA continent that is mostly occupied by the \nAhurian Empire, with the notable exception of the\nsoutheast desert.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/locations/ralaka/","path":"/locations/ralaka/","title":"Ralaka"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/locations/ratna/":{"body":"Ratna is a small hamlet in the boondocks of Aubergine.\n= Notable People\n== Old Man Fitzgerald\nA shamanic healer\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/locations/ratna/","path":"/locations/ratna/","title":"Ratna"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/locations/rigatona/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/locations/rigatona/","path":"/locations/rigatona/","title":"Rigatona"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/locations/salermo/":{"body":"\n  Warning\nThis article is a stub!

Founded by the legendary Hama, the group became the defenders of Raibon Island from foreign interlopers, and the rest of the world of Thera from interplanar ones.\nThe existence of the Hags of Hama stretches back to pre-Kalassarian times, but rose to prominence in the terrtories that would become the Apgarian Confederacy two decades before the Fall of the Western Empire. Many of their rituals and traditions extend to even before the Kalassarians dubbed what is presently Raibon Island as Mauricia. Those traditions rooted from the Estregan Hausi sea peoples who had populated the islands. These aboriginal tribes venerated the White Witches of Tichom. Tichom was their name for Raibon, which meant \"Largest Piece Beyond the Edge\" in the old Estregan dialect they spoke. The name \"White Witches\" is how the Hags referred to themselves within the group, and the term is also used to refer to them among the locals of L'Illes Apgarie.\nHistory🔗\nNot much is corroborated about the history of the Hags of Hama. For example, until recently, the eponymous Hama, founder of the Hags, was thought to be a mythical character instead of a true historical figure. Historians, especially those of the Divine Masochist tradition doubted the veracity of their purported abilities. The Orthodox Divine Masochist position that magic disappeared from the land after the persecution and death of the Masochist was in contradiction with the assertion that the Hags of Hama were able to perform magical feats well into the 9th century AI. Even some of the more prominent contemporary scholars after the Fall of Bastion cast doubt on writings about the powers of the Hags, as they were quite the outlier in the historical record. Current scholarship purports that by the 5th century, most magical societies seem to have lost the ability on a wide scale. It was not until the 6th day of the 8th month of 1275 AI that the it was even confirmed that the Town of Hama existed, when the crew of the Rozenmaiden under the leadership of Captain Hedwig Rosa Rosenkrantz triggered its return via magical means. \nResearch and excavation efforts have only recently begun, and are only currently being executed by members of the Hags themselves, and amateur crew-members of the Rozenmaiden, with only informal invitations to members of the academia pending talks regarding the town's legal status within the Apgarian Government.\nProvided here is a timeline of known events about the Hags of Hama:\nDateEvent\n500?

They were established due to\nthe limited resources that can be allocated to an armed force, such as a gendarmerie in \n{{ loc=\"Raibon Island\" }} due to the Treaty of Turain.\nHistory🔗\nIn the years following the end of the Poasan-Apgarian Conflict, the\nTreaty of Turain limited the amount of armed forces on \n\n\n\n\n\nRaibon Island as a whole. While the \nGendarmerie had an exception in its existence\nas a defense force and a law-enforcement group, its resources were greatly limited to\nprevent arming them, and using the exception as a loophole to militarize the island.\nFor this reason, the Governor of \n\n\n\n\nSanery who administers Raibon authorized\nthe use of a bounty system to augment these forces. In this way, they can account for the \nexpense differently. While this system was useful for catching high-value criminals, this\nsystem let low-level thugs off the hook, as not being worth the effort due to the relatively\nlow value of such bounties. \nWhile the bounty system did initially relieve the gendarmerie of the burden of additional\nrecruitment and related equipment costs, it was clear that after a few years, it was not a\nsustainable measure, as the baseline of lawlessness on Tressemer increased.\nThe Mercenary Guild🔗\nTo address the increasing lawlessness, a group that included some prominent mercenaries from\nthe \n\nHunting Lodge petitioned the \n\nTown Council of Tressemer, \nand proposed that bounty hunters must be a member of a guild before being allowed \nto take bounties.\nThe proposed Mercenary Guild would then enforce a tiered bounty system, where each specific \ninstance of lawlessness was given a rank and a specific monetary value. In order to take higher \nbounties, members would be required to maintain a quota of lower-tier bounties first. The \nCouncil accepted the proposal and enacted an ordinance formalzing the Mercenary Guild by 1257.\nFormation🔗\nIn 1260, \n\n\n\n\nAnda Antorra was disturbed by the amount of people unjustly caught\nby other mercenaries, making false charges to quickly fill the low-tier quota. She used her \nearnings from bounties to hire other mercenaries to catch those who were creating trumped up\ncharges to enrich themselves. As this kind of fraud was considered a higher-tier bounty, \nshe still needed to ensure that they met the minimum quota of lower-tier bounties.\nSo, she convinced these mercenaries to pool their resources, so they might rotate between these\nlower-tier and higher-tier bounties without much disruption to their priority.\nAs they increased in popularity, Antorra saw other mercenaries want to join their \"tier pool\".\nBut at these scales, she believed that she needed to formalize the operation. The called their\ngroup The Peacekeepers of Tressemer and created a framework of guidelines that members would\nhave to follow.\nExpansion🔗\nSince the foundation of the Peacekeepers, Antorra kept on reinvesting her own earnings into it.\nShe purchased equipment from \n\nKincade Enterprises to ensure that her mercenaries\nhad what they needed to perform their tasks, established informant networks to make it easier for\nthem to gain information on their marks, and other such expansion efforts.\nOther mercenaries wanted to take advantage of all those advantages, and wanted to join into the\npool, that soon, they pretty much cornered the market on lower-tier jobs that it became a de \nfacto requirement for a mercenary to deal with the Peacekeepers to do mercenary work in \nTressemer.\nOfficial Deputization🔗\nBy 1265, the Peacekeepers of Tressemer have grown to such a degree that it already had enough\ninfrastructure to act as a law-enforcement agency all on its own. Its own bylaws and guidelines\nwere in line with those of the gendarmerie itself, and in some cases even exceeded its\nrequirements. Through the intercession of then vice mayor \n\n\n\n\nGustavia Krana,\nAnda Antorra was able to petition the Governor to officially dissolve the Mercenary Guild, and \nmerge its functions into the Peacekeepers' own. A motion was passed in the \n\n\n\n\n\nSanery Capitol Building that rubberstamped the deputization.\nPresent-Day Functions🔗\nToday, the Peacekeepers encompass all functions of a law-enforcement agency, including border\npatrol, dock inspection and penitentiaries. They act as the local policing force as well, \nremoving the need of the gendarmerie to maintain a force in Port Tressemer.\nFunding comes through cuts from bounties, and from funding for non-combat related services.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/organizations/peacekeepers-of-tressemer/","path":"/organizations/peacekeepers-of-tressemer/","title":"Peacekeepers of Tressemer"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/organizations/phantasmagoria/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/organizations/phantasmagoria/","path":"/organizations/phantasmagoria/","title":"Phantasmagoria"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/organizations/port-rainoso-local-government/":{"body":"Being the capital of Raibon Island, but only one of two major ports, Rainoso's Local government has influence on the smaller townships on the island, even if they are technically about the same political level.\nAs is the standard set in the Apgarian Confederacy. the local government has 2 branches of government.

Their souls could not be easily untethered from the Threads of the World, otherwise they might stray from the Starlit Path, and lose themselves in the Great Darkness. \nHe ordered a Grand Convocation, a grand census of the Lands of the Divine to determine how far along each person is along the Starlit\nPath.

It is qualified with the orthodox moniker to differentiate from other Masochistic faiths that have splintered off from it.\nConnections to the Arzhadadi religion\nDivine Masochism is rooted from the Arzhadadi religion Mangul-am-Arzhadad worshiped in an island off the coast of Giza called Arzhadi-et-Betet. The followers of the Divine Masochist believed that he was the one foretold by a number of Arzhadadi prophets who would lead their people to freedom against the oppression of the Kalasarian and bring the world empires to heel.\nMost followers of the Mangul believe that at best, the man called the Divine Masochist is, at best, the latest of many prophets that prepare the stage for the Arzhadam, or the raising of the people of Arzhadad.\nHistory\nThe One Appointed by God\nIn the 2nd century BF, a group of hermetic monks believed that they have finally\nfound the \"one appointed by God\", and had raised him as a vicious critic of the\nArzhadad theocracy, and the Kalasarian empire's governance. By the time the man \nwas his 20s, Hesse son of Hoseppe (Arsi-tam-Osepi in their language) became a\nvery influential political figure. His father's lineage was traced by Arzhadi\nscribes to a the Lewanan--a tribe of priests that once led the golden age of the\nArzhadad. \nMarsa's Slave\nHesse, however, was unceremoniously imprisoned by the Kalasarian governor\nPasanian, and was sentenced to death by whipping within a week after his\ncapture. The governor's daughter Marsa was however, quite taken in by Hesse. So\nshe pleaded with her father to release him to her as a slave--a gift for her\nbirthday. He agreed reluctantly, and burned slave brands into Hesse's left\nshoulder before handing Marsa his writ of slavery. \nMarsa had always admired Hesse's assuredness, but had disagreed with his many\npolitical, moral and theological stances, so as Hesse labored under Marsa, she\nhad confronted him with many philosophical problems. Hesse answered her problems\nwith parables about various people and the fine line between pleasure and pain.\nThe intensity of the arguments had only become more aggressive, which ultimately\ncame to one of the first written depictions of sado-masochism. Hesse was so\nenraptured by the acts, that Marsa herself became the most ardent believer. \nThe Mission\nTheirs was so profound a partnership, that thousands upon thousands watched\ntheir demonstrations, which was interspersed with Hesse's teachings about the\nimportance of the application of pain and suffering to understand the meaning of\npleasure and love.\nThe two had amassed a large number of followers, including some prominent\nreligious scholars, most of whom once derided Hesse as a fraud. The doctrine of\nthe masochist also drew in convicts said to have been wrongfully accused, and\nhad been forced to know pain. The governor's third son, Marsa's half-brother\nMeahu was also enamored, and eventually became one of the most devout followers.\nThe Arzhadad religious establishment, however, viewed Hesse's teachings to be\nunorthodox and dangerous, most profoundly, in their view, was the religious\nposition Marsa was being given as their followers have come to view her as the\nVenerable Matron. The subservient role that Hesse apparently took was\nmisconstrued as acceptance of slavery, which both Hesse and Marsa vehemently\ndenied. \nOn the 5th year of preaching, a novice follower and a partner had performed some\nacts of sado-masochism, but had gone too far, leading to severe internal\nbleeding and death. It was all the Arzhadad theocracy needed to have cause to\nincarcerate Hesse and Marsa. They had implored the governor to execute him,\nusing the prophecy as proof that the true goal of the mission was to undermine\nthe Kalasarian regime, and to recruit rebels to fight. Stories of mass\ngatherings have been common enough that the governor had reason to believe the\nreport. Governor Pasarian then ordered Hesse and his daughter captured.\nBeliefs\nThe Divine Masochist\nThe Venerable Mother\nThe Angels of Creation and the Demons of Ruin\nThe Angels of Creation were creatures of immense power, said to have been\nendowed by God himself with the powers of creation. However, as they were\nenacting His plan, they have begun to question the merits of certain points of\nthe Grand Plan. After they had come to complete construction of the universe,\nthey have perceived what they thought of as imperfections in the fabric of the\nuniverse, focusing on the portfolio bestowed upon them.\nThe extreme focus had led them to lose sight of the greater purpose of the Plan.\nThey obsessed in the primacy of their domains, that they have turned into dark,\ndestructive versions of themselves. If they see something that goes beyond their\nmandate, they immediately seek to destroy it.\nThe Angels of Creation were not part of the original canon of scripture of the\nearly Church. It had been an extremely popular novel, which incorporated\nreligious themes from the displaced pagan religions of the Kalasar. The story\ncontinued with the Venerable Mother and the Divine Masochist, preaching in the\ndesert, where they were confronted by the demons one by one.

And all was Good and Peaceful, so the Lord slumbered. As He slept, his unknowable mind dreamt. As as he dreamed, he made the World. But the world was yet barren and lifeless. So it came to be the He made the Angel of Nature, to help Him fill the entirety of Creation. With them, He made the planes, the stars, the planets, the plants and animals, then the people.\nBut at the time, the people were not much better than animals themselves. The Angel of Nature made the people formed in their own image, and blessed with the essence of intelligence. But as with all in nature, all is in balance, and the people were embattled to survive. \nThen the Lord saw these creations and immediately loved them, that He gave them his favor. He parted with more of His Divine Essence with the brightest of the stars of creation, then from its core was borne the Angel of Civilization. The Angel as most intelligent, and bestowed upon the people the gift of Lore. From the first Lore the people learned of fire. Then they learned to reap Nature's gifts and sow them thus and learned agriculture. Then they felt the majestly of the Divine Essence itself surround them, and learned of Ritma.\nThe people were made plentiful and spread through all corners of the world. They have become shepherds, stewards of Nature and Civilization's gifts and made marvels big and small.\nBut the people soon were consumed by these gifts, giving all thought to their construction, and soon exploitation. The most gifted sought ways to use their marvels to gain more than what they needed.  The lesser ones of quiet cunning used guile and deceit to dress their failings, and take from those gullible others. Their manifest pride had grown beyond belief at the marvel of their works and forgot they themselves were given the gifts they wholly claimed as their own. Even the Angel of Civilization began to be boastful at the greatness their gifts have wrought to the people who were to be their charge. Thus came the first Devil, the Devil of Hubris.\nThe people were goaded by Hubris to leap beyond and aim toward the moon and the stars, to pierce wider into the planes beyond sight. In so doing, they wrought descruction to many of Nature's bounty. This had angered the Angel of Nature, for it tipped the balance too far. They created locusts and rust monsters to right the scales once more, destroying all indiscriminately to come to their goal. They have become the Devil of Pestilence.\nThose left behind began to fall into despair and pain, and prayed to the Lord for salvation. The Divine took pity on them and saw that more of Himself must be given. For He had given them His Nature and His Civilization, but none of His virtue. So, the Divine shaped the Angels of Virtue. \nTo combat Hubris he brought about the Angel of Humility. \nTo fight against the darkness of Pestilence, come the Angel of Delight. \nThen to guide all to do what is right, he sent the Angel of Justice.\nThen all was Good and Peaceful.\nBut even virtues may turn to sin on excess. Delight gave and offered such pleasures more base and more carnal that the people became ensnared in addiction. They could not stop, nor would they want, and they became the Devil of Debauchery. \nPeople's pride at their works and marvels were great, and intermingled with Debauchery. The Angel of Humility was driven mad against the sheer weight of all and began using their power to hold and dominate those that would not listen. They would become forceful, to the point that any progress was brought low by their feet. Thus was born, the Devil of Inhibition. \nMired in sin, and the influence of the new Devils, the Angel of Justice could no longer tolerate the evil that they saw.

Legends from even the pagan religions often tell tales of angels who serve as messengers, attendants or adjudicators of gods. They do not traverse the planes for trivial pursuits. Often when they leave the Celestial Planes, they do so on a divine mission from their master.\nNot a lot is known about angels, and the records that do exist are very hyperbolic in their description that authenticity or accuracy is questionable. What most descriptions have in common, aside from their white-feathered wings, is that they radiate a brilliant, blinding light on command. That their visage is enough to demand only truth be spoken in their presence.\nReligious Traditions🔗\nDivine Masochists: The Prime Angels and the Fallen🔗\nThe Divine Masochists believe that the Divine himself created the first angel. In the Scripture of the Way, the Book of Knimonad describes the order manner of their creation. It also describes a possible transformation of an angel into a devil, assuming the document is taken at face value. These angels were eventually called the Prime Angels religious scholars. Their Devil forms are also called the Prime Devils\nAngelic FormDevilish Form\nAngel of NatureDevil of Pestilence\nAngel of CivilizationDevil of Hubris\nAngel of DelightDevil of Debauchery\nAngel of HumilityDevil of Inhibition\nAngel of JusticeDevil of Intolerance\n\nScholars of Comparative Theology in the University of Sanery have asserted that the Prime Angels are so similar to the gods and goddesses of the Kalassarian Paganist, then the subsequent Apgarian Paganist rites because they were integrated by Kalassarian theologists in order to harmonize the beliefs in an attempt to ease the entirety of the empire to accept their new official religion. The lesser angels' roles were also similarly transplanted into the doctrine.\nPaganist Traditions🔗\nThe descendants of the Kalassarian Paganist traditions, such as the Apgarian Paganist Rite similarly assert that angels are servants to the gods. They employ legions of angels recruited from the Celestial Planes to do their bidding, for so as long as they are right. They do not have, in their lore, any reference to transformations of angels to devils. They only mention fallen angels, and enlightened devils in scenarios where the creatures have escaped their natures.\nRanks of Angels🔗\nThe promotion of an angel to the next rank is called an Ascension. They are thought to progess by providing service to their lords, and receiving commendations for their works. It's believed that simply being told to ascend by a respected authority figure with conviction, they would instantly transform into their next form. \nDeva🔗\nDevas are the lowest ranking angels that are sent to missions toward the various planes. Their mandate is to usually perform their tasks in the most subtle means which align with the morals of their lord. They are usually tasked to aid certain individuals or groups, but are not allowed to act on their behalf directly.\nPlanetar🔗\nPlanetars are considered weapons of their god. They are sent as a sort of deterrent to threats against their god or their god's followers. They have the divine power to immediately see througn any deception, magical or otherwise. They are able to act with more autonomy than a Deva, and may in fact command Devas that serve the same entity.\nWhen miracles are performed in a god's name, it is usually through the intercession of a planetar.\nSolar🔗\nNot many is known about the existence of Solars, aside from what is referenced in pagan oral traditions. They are listed as to be of higher rank than the Planetars and act as stewards for their god, and that each god has a single Solar always at their side. They are speculated to have powers that include and extend past those of the ranks below.\nAngel Moral Alignment🔗\nIt is unknown how angels come at their moral alignment, and become so deeply intwined with them that they follow every letter of them to a fault. They are considered to embody everything that is \"good\", but how \"good\" is interpreted can vary wildly across belief systems. For the most part, what the angel does consider good, aligns absolutety with a god's. For example, a hypothetical angel of the Reformed Church of the Divine Masochist may find it completely acceptable that they inflict flagellation on their members.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/species/angel/","path":"/species/angel/","title":"Angels"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/species/celestial/":{"body":"\n  Warning\nThis article is a stub!

They are an intelligent, but highly traditional \nand ritualistic people whose lives revolve around the protection and stabilization of their tribes. There are said \nto be 7 main tribes in power within the Forest region of Sorha, and have a cultural divide that is, as delineated\nby many of the Dolo-Dolo themselves, as the Eastern and Western tribes. These groupings are defined by \nwhich side of the Stairway to the Heavens their ancestral lands lie upon.\nHistorical references to the Dolo-Dolo were put in question by many modern scholars of Ahurian history prior to the \nFall of Burtz. They surmise that most of these histories and records were semi-mythical, whose sources were colored\nby a certain historiographical tradition that ascribed unexplained events or perceptions to popular theological references.\nIn these cases, historians believed that Dolo-Dolo sightings were used to explain strange sightings within forest regions\ndue to the popularity of the Tale of the Great Ahuriyata and the Dolo-Dolo Trickster. They offer as proof the virtual\ndisappearance of Dolo-Dolo sightings and references after 700 AI. Of course, recent events around the world, where peoples once\nconsidered mythological have begun to surface, especially actual tribes in Sorha who call themselves the Dolo-Dolo have renewed\ninterest in re-examining these histories and called into question the historiographical theories on the subject.\nMythology🔗\nAhurian Tradition🔗\nMost Ahurians have only heard of the Dolo-Dolo through the Tale of the Great Ahuriyata and the Dolo-Dolo Trickster.\nSome variations of the tale exist, as it was conveyed orally by many a tavern performer within Ahuria's centuries\nof dominance in the Ralakan continent. It tells the story of how the Great Ahuriyata had first traveled through the \nForests of Sorha in search of the mountain the Stairway to the Heavens would eventually be founded upon. Within\nthat forest, there was a mysterious creature that seemed to stalk the Great Ahuriyata, with the intention of \neating him for dinner. \nThe Great Ahuriyata, of course, was too cunning himself, and was too wily for the Dolo-Dolo's\ntrickery, and was, instead able to fool him. However, when the Great Ahuriyata was about to leave the forest,\nthe Dolo-Dolo was caught in a monster's snare. The Great Ahuriyata saves him from his plight, Extremely grateful\nfor the kindness that he was showed even after the Dolo-Dolo's attempt at trickery, he pledged his everlasting\nsupport to the Ahuriyata and his kin.\nDolomite Tradition🔗\nThe Dolo-Dolo of Sorha have a similar tale that is passed down from generation, but the trickery is played out by the adversary of the Dolo-Dolo religion--Herasi the Deceitful. Herasi was a spiteful character that did ill to random individuals who may have entered, supposedly without permission, in land that he wrongfully claims as his. So as the Great Ahuriyata entered the Forest of the Dolo-Dolo, Herasi takes the face of a Dolo-Dolo female in distress to lure the renowned hero into a trap.\nThe Ahuriyata falls for the deception after a very convincing performance. Before Herasi was able to land the final blow however, a Dolo-Dolo tribesman and his child stumbled upon the scene. With their&gt; spears, they drove the Deceitful One away. \nNow the Dolo-Dolo tribesman, whose name and lineage differ depending upon the tribe telling the tales, came from an impoverished tribe on the brink of starvation due to a famine induced by the very same Herasi. They feared that Herasi would now punish them even more after exposing his true form the the erstwhile interloper that entered the Deceitful One's territory. The Ahuriyata, grateful from the help he just received, and angry for the suffering that Herasi had set upon these good people, decided to help them thwart the Deceitful One once and for all.\nThey enact an elaborate plan to lure Herasi into their encampment, offering a young face and form that suits the trickster's preference. His current body was at this point turning quite old and frail, so the replacement was a welcome one. Unbeknown to Herasi, the Great Ahuriyata was already lying in wait by the time he entered the young man's home. The Great Ahuriyata then springs into action and reveals his trap--a gigantic black-green orb that is capable of binding creatures of magic such as he within it; To this day, this giant, yet seemingly inert Attractor, sits dormant underneath the Dolomite Mountains. \nSome traditions surmise that once the Mother of Orbs escapes its prison, it would allow the sphere they call the\nOrb of Binding to feed upon that larger, more directed source of magic and free Herasi to commit his crimes once more.\nHistory🔗\nEvidence suggests that the Dolo-Dolo were the first settlers of the Ralakan Continent. Earliest fossils of\nDolo-Dolo settlements were found in the Purha area. Within 100,000 years, they would have settlements found all over the continent up to present-day Pise.\nFragments of Kureran thought-records excavated from Mehicania date some of the earliest interactions with the Dolo-Dolo at present-day Sorha went back to at least 950 PF. The recording was of an explorer following one of the rivers, possibly the Tamisami River that runs through the entirety of the Forest region, was rescued by a band of Dolo-Dolo foragers. This remains, to this day, the most extensive ethnography of the Dolo-Dolo. The \"thought\" from the Kureran thought-recording detailed the initial encounter, their language at the time, and their cultural and technological capabilities. The insight it offered, was that the Dolo-Dolo was not the typical primitive hunter-gatherer. Instead, they had sophisticated techniques that favored a type of subsistence farming that ensured that they had as little an impact to the ecology surrounding them as possible.\nRecordings from Old Ahurian sources included similar information years later, but without the level of technical understanding that the Kurerans were able to detail in their account. It is notable, however, that the Old Ahurian recording was roughly 1,000 years after the former recordings, and recent analysis would indicate that the ethnographical details were largely identical. \nAfter 500 AI, references to Dolo-Dolo dwindled to almost nothing, coinciding with a global trend of a diminishing number of historical manuscripts related to extra-human abilities and races. Any remaining references to them are fictional, religious or allegorical in nature instead. It is now widely believed that the reason for this global trend has something to do with the disappearance of magical energy from the world. Since there was little to no more latent magical energy in the atmosphere, extra-human creatures stopped being born. Eventually the remaining extant populations died out in a few generations. After a few more, living memory of creatures like the Dolo-Dolo likely disappeared, and had been consigned to myth.\nIt is disputed, however, that the Dolo-Dolo died out and reborn in the style of the Verdines and the Cornups. The fact that the most recent reports of Dolo-Dolo communities are consistent with centuries-old records. While some scholars believe that this might mean that many of their cultural habits and mores are instinctual, others yet believe that they did not die out at all, and have survived in some form throughout the centuries. The debate is still open on this point, and may only be settled after a lengthy anthropological investigation.\nEthnography🔗\nDolo-Dolo do not have a similar agriculture to the typical human style. They developed techniques that involve stimulating plant growth with various non-invasive fertilization and irrigation strategies. They planted roots, shrubs and trees in accordance to known growth rates and their community's consumption. They were aware of growing seasons, but they did not make large-scale farms, nor did they domesticate cultivars of common staples. Instead, they have simply \"helped\" natural growth of flora in their general vicinity. Sorha itself was plentiful enough that they did not need to live as more typical hunter-gatherers do and roam a wide area throughout a season, instead, they tailored their diet to what was available in a season. \nIn addition, they had a magical tradition similar to those of Druids. Since, however, most Dolo-Dolo already use most of the magical energy they process internally to sustain their large bodies, they have learned to use the Orbs of EnhRulesancement that naturally form in the caverns underneath the Sorhan mountain ranges to help with variations in growth conditions and disease control. \nDolo-Dolo hunting was very ritualistic and self-sustaining. They only hunted certain species of deer, buffalo and pheasant in appropriate seasons, and only those who have grown to a certain size and age. This ensured that they would not reduce their population potential. The only animal they ever domesticated, were a variety of Tahusa Valley horse that were able to subsist on a very prolific variety of wild oat.\nDolo-Dolo homes were built close together, from wood cut deliberately in a ritualistic manner and only under certain conditions. Then the wood is then processed into 2\"x2\" pieces of lumber. A rectangular hole is then dug into the ground roughly the size of the dwelling. After which, four poles are driven about half a foot diagonally from each corner of the hole. Two rows of lumber are then placed in parallel to each other against the poles on opposing sides. The distance of each pole is most often spaced slightly less than the length of the pieces of lumber used. Above, two more parallel pieces are placed perpendicular to the first layer, this is repeated until a structure of about a height of 7 feet is made. Appropriate gaps for a doorway is left, often facing the direction of the rising sun. Logs are then placed in an octagon shape on top, with a smaller diameter each level, until only a 1'x1' gap is left. Clay is packed to cover the wooden frame and roofing. A hollow log is placed in the middle of the gap as a chimney stack, and is held in place with the clay. Finally, the structure is left to dry in the sun until it hardens. Proximity of each dwelling is dependent on the family unit.\nRites of Hospitality🔗\nMartial Traditions🔗\nIn the earliest days of the interactions between the Dolo-Dolo and the Kurerans, the intelligent, gentle giants of the Ralakan contintent did not have need to field and train large armies from its ranks, or train in a formalized style of fighting. The Dolo-Dolo tribes were rarely in conflict with each other for too long. Since the forests were plentiful, and the mountains dispensed means of easing the world's random ills, they aren't pushed by the typical troubles of famine and pestilence. They welcome death as a dear friend, as most die of old age and weariness instead of pain and disease. That was, until other peoples and races have discovered their lands, and the riches they contained. \nRite of Satisfaction🔗\nTraditionally, the Dolo-Dolo settled conflicts and aggression among themselves by invoking the Rite of Satisfaction. It is a ritualized dispute resolution mechanism where parties involved may choose one willing and able champion to fight to the death for their cause. It was to signify that they were willing to defend their argument to the death. If one party chooses to yield the argument, they would be allowed to live, but at the cost of their reputation. Their belief is that one who invokes the rite must have made the effort to truly believe in the truth of their cause that they would be willing to die for it, and yielding proves that they, in fact, do not have that confidence regarding the weight of their argument, and that they were foolish enough to only see through their error at risk of death.\nThere were only a few rules in the performance of a Rite of Satisfaction. All parties must agree with the following rules and stipulations:\n\nThat the source of conflict was deemed irreconcilable by non-violent means\nThat all effort had been exhausted in the attempt of resolving the conflict by those means \nThat parties involved must understand the implications of the Rite of Satisfaction. \nThat parties must agree upon a boon to be given to the winning party. \nThat arms or spells which affect the opposing forces' state of mind are prohibited.\nThat arms or spells which might cause harm outside the parties involved are prohibited.\nThat arms or spells which allow travel beyond the bounds of the rite are prohibited.\nThat once a champion yells \"yield\", the rite has ended. Any violence after will no longer have the protection of the rite.\nThat the results of the Rite of Satisfaction must be honored by all parties, and the boon be rightfully awarded to the winner.2\nFurther dispute on the matter, with the exact same parties involved can no longer invoke the Rite of Satisfaction, as a parties involved should have already been satisfied.\nDeath be to those that cause harm regarding the matter after satisfaction had been granted. \n\nThe ritual surrounding the Rite of Satisfaction slightly vary between tribes, but remain fairly similar throughout. The traditions of the most ascendant of the tribes involved take precedence if they are involved and are not one of the parties to invoke it.\nEastern Tribes🔗\nKyanite🔗\nChief: Pasha\nChildren:\n\nTonto\nChar'hi\n\nBoleite🔗\nChief: Fisiha\nBanner: Blue banner with Canary \nCobaltite🔗\nChief:\nBanner: Gray banner w/ Gold Harp\nEkanite🔗\nChief: Kahamat'ha\nBanner: Pink Banner with fresh goat heads\nNatrolite🔗\nChief: Panakulho\nBanner: White Natrolite on Black Background\nWestern Tribes🔗\n27 day of chosima - dolo-dolo friendship day\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/species/dolo-dolo/","path":"/species/dolo-dolo/","title":"Dolo-Dolo"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/species/elf/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/species/elf/","path":"/species/elf/","title":"Elf"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/species/face-stealer/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/species/face-stealer/","path":"/species/face-stealer/","title":"Face-Stealer"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/species/fairy/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/species/fairy/","path":"/species/fairy/","title":"Fairy"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/species/frogmen/":{"body":"\n  Warning\nThis article is a stub!

So I had moved our lecture outdoors today.  It was a more impromptu lesson, instead of the one that I had planned. It seemed appropriate for me to tailor my lesson to the setting.\nWe went to the peach orchard to discuss the change of the seasons, and the natural processes associated with them. Since we are currently experiencing this change, I started with the transition of winter to spring. She seemed to have enjoyed the lesson very much!

It seemed her joviality was infectious. I swear, the leaves seem to have become greener in her presence!\nWe went back to the palatial residence6, exhausted but, in my opinion, quite fulfilled.

There was a time when the eminent \nConfederation of Apgarian States was not even possible in the imaginations of its constituents' ancestors. \nEach of Apgar's component states were once kingdoms, formed in the twilight of the Great Kalassarian Empire. In the intravening years between the Fall of the Western Kalassarian Empire in 466 and the First of the three Apgarian Revolutions in 976, these kingdoms formed, clashed, dissolved and subsumed each other, and shaped world events in their own right. Most well-known of these world-shaking events beloved\nby historians are the First and Second Anasaian-Estregan Wars, which saw the Kingdom of Poasah become a nation of great influence in the Beteran political zeitgeist.\nIt is of great interest then, to see how these kingdoms have formed, as the once-indomitable Kalassar crumbled from internal and external pressures. This article does not aim to be an exhaustive treatise into the minutia of of every dynamic that led to the present-day situation of these entities, however. \nThe aim is to provide an introduction for the layman and the freshman into the wonderful, perplexing and intriguing intricacies of this portion of history.\nThe Whys and Hows of the Fall of the Kalassarian Empire🔗\nMost historians mark the year 466 as the line in the proverbial sand for the Western Kalassarian Empire. That line in the sands of time goes directly through the Razing of the City of Kalassus by the Ahurians under Kolha I's banner on the day of the 965th anniversary of its foundation. This date may have been a keystone event in the dissolution of West Kalassar, but it is by no means its true end. Even after the City Everlasting saw its last, the Imperial bureaucracy was still keeping the various western dioceses running, albeit in a sickly state compared to the Empire's heyday. The fact that it was razed so quickly and so completely does highlight clues that would help solve the mystery of the Great Empire's demise.\nThe Kalassarian military was very well-known to have an uncanny ability to be instantaneously battle-ready, and just as quickly deployed to any battlefield anywhere in the known limits of the world. But they somehow had failed to return to the place of its birth at its most dire moment. In fact, during this period in history, they seem to have lost this legendary ability. They were fighting on multiple fronts at the time: In the Potol region east of Poasah (present-day Tanduaria, the Tandoor were constantly raiding major population centers. In Hapgaria, they were quelling the Baraonian Rebellion. Even elsewhere in the Tonara Peninsula, General Brutallus was breaking the siege at Saray (found in present-day Summa). \nIn the past, there were many times when the Kalassarian Legions fought multi-front wars and were able to, simultaneously, secure the capital. So what changed? Perhaps they no longer had the same capacity to field soldiers? Perhaps there were logistics issues that made it impossible to mount a defense this time around? These remain the most popular views in academia today. I myself was of the persuasion an alternative view was presented by Head of the Department of Extrahuman Abilities of the venerable University of Calamutz, Professor Zafira Lor Pise.&nbsp;\nShe and her excellent students have unearthed a piece of magical technology that the Kalassarian military may have used to perform these extraordinary feats of logistics. Professor Zafira invited me into the stately Pise manor for the demonstration. She enthusiatlcally explained that the circle drawn with meticulous arcane symbols might just be what facilitates the Kalassarian Logistical Miracle. Circumscribed within the circle is a pentagram. Each point of the pentagram had a metallic cup with a stem attached to the bottom. These stems were driven into the ground on those points. Ms Pise explained that those cups would contain diamonds, which are supposedly a necessary catalyst for what will happen next.\nShe and a number of her students, Cornups all, stepped within the circle. I hesitantly joined them. One of her students chanted some words, then all of a sudden, we were all drawn into a darkness. The sensation is hard to describe. It's like falling down while standing completely still, you're stomach lurching every which way. Then in an instant, within the single tick of the professor's pocket watch, we were in the site of some newly unearthed ruins in Mehicania. Within the same half-hour, I was in one of my lecture halls in the university, and all of a sudden, I was drinking chocolate in a Mehicanian salon! \nProfessor Zafira explained that the Teleportation Circle that was in her basement is something well-known wizards of most world militaries by this day in 1275. That wasn't the point. It was the fact that the same spell seems to have been able to interface with the Circle we've transported to.\nThe Circle discovered in Mehicania was massive. It was exactly 400 yards in diameter--enough to transport an entire legion of centurions in an single instant. Professor Zafira has an excellent publication on the subject1. It offers a complete recontextualization of this portion of history, and details their research methodology.\nResearch by the Department of Extra-Human Abilities indicate that the mystical ability called the Ritma, what we know as \"magic\", was required to trigger the transport. \nThe fact that we can use Teleportation Circles today would be due to the sudder re-occurence of magic within the few decades. Professor Zafira hypothesizes that this ability, and magic in general gradually faded away. She surmises that ome global event seemed to have slowly cause it to recede--either a natural phenomenon, or a cultural one--something on the scale of the Orb at Bastion.&nbsp;From estimates in their preliminary studies, the decline may have began as early as the tail end of the 3rd century. Use of the Ritma may have disappeared entirely by the time Kalassus was burned to the ground. It is my view that this was not a coincidence. If the Ritma was gone by then, the ability of the Kalassarian Empire to transport large portions of the army and the necessary supplies across the continent, fighting a three front war became untenable. The fact that they even attempted just showed that they have taken all of this for granted. When it disappeared, it seems that they did not have the strategic and logistical capacity to consider alternatives. \nThe logistical challenges in the early 5th century did not only affect military logistics. Civil infrastructure also started to decline. Radial roads within regions were still relatively well-maintained, but the inter-region byways were in a state of disrepair that would be unacceptable even in today's fraught political climate. Towns and villages further away from city centers were no longer served, and were being taken over by brigands. In some cases, the brigands were the administrators themselves, acting autonomously in their own self-interest now that central authority is too far away for any meaningful punitive action.\nThere are indications that other industries suffered from the disappearance of Ritma as well. Agricultural yields were at its lowest ever, with unprecedented levels of famine across the entirety of the Western empire. There are preliminary discoveries that might indicate that these yields were also boslered by Ritma, so variations in crop yield became more erratic. By the time the climate changes that triggered the movement of nomadic tribes like the Tandoor2, crop yields were very vulnerable\nto weather variations as well.\nSo we see some of the most crucial, but non-exhaustive, whys quite clearly. Especially when compared with the Kalassar during its golden age:\n\n\nMilitary efficiency was greatly impeded by these logistical, intelligence and strategic constraints, which made the empire vulnerable to external threats.\n\n\nBureaucratic mechanisms stagnated in the best-case, bottle-necked in the average-case, and deadlocked in the worst-case, which likely have caused, systematized, and extenuated the documented instances of institutionalized corruption in many localized regions.\n\n\nAgricultural capacity was much lower than the needs of the population, which caused widespread unrest, which in turn resulted in many instances of revolt, especially in the most underserved areas.\n\n\nEven without the additional context that the Ritma offers, these whys and their network effects already greatly explain the issues that the Kalassar faced. They even explain the pattern in which the early feudal states began to fragment away from its bipartite, but still somewhat central authority. The additional context of the Ritma explains how fast the decline and collapse of the Western Kalassarian Empire occurred and the nature of the feudal system that had arisen from its wake. For example, after the collapse of the Kalassus Region due to the Kolhan Invasion, the few forces that remained retreated to the mountainous areas in the Logossus and Sernassus mountain ranges, where they would build mountaintop castles as fortification against Ahurian siege engines.\nMeanwhile in Hapgaria, Baraon was in open rebellion due to a dwindling economy and a multi-year famine, but other parts of Hapgaria, like Sanery and Estrega were relatively stable until the 450s due to their proximity to the sea. Across the channel, Senera acted autonomously, with governmental functions running relatively smoothly almost the entire time, only declaring itself a kingdom in its own right year after Kalassus was razed, when the Potol region was taken by the Tandoor.\nThe Baraonian Rebellion🔗\nKnown as the bread-basket of the West, Baraon was critically-important to the food supply of the western half of the empire. Grain and other staple foods, such as potatoes, beets and lentils. The wide plains and mostly consistent weather, and easy access to aquifers from the Repa and Tarpa mountains make it usually give rise to the region's very favorable farming conditions. But in the early 400s, the Baraon region, which not only included most of the present-day state of Baraon, but extended northward to most of today's southern Poasah, southward to most of [location:186] and eastward to the entirety of [location:183], was hit by a series of droughts and crop failures. At the same time, the [event:75]&nbsp;cut-off the region from supplies from the eastern parts of the empire. Famine and disease soon followed. People were miserable, disheartened, and most importantly, angry. Angry at the rich administrators of Baraon, who have been callously flouting personal supplies and goods from overseas trade partners by holding lavish parties among themselves while the rest of the populace starved.\nSporadic uprisings among the peasantry began springing up near the fringes of the region. Most of them, however, was put down quite handily, since the legions were still in the pay of the administration. As the famine and the war extended beyond a decade, additional taxes were being levied against the merchants and the larger landowners. It doesn't take much imagination that they did not take this lying still. A consortium of these merchants and landowners began pooling their resources together in order to hire mercenaries to lead the rebellion.\nIn the year 440, rumblings that even the legions were no longer satisfied with the way things are going. Yes, they were being paid, but Kalassarian coinage didn't mean much when there wasn't much to buy at all. The famine, in combination to the reduced mobility caused by the Ahurian assaults and raids in Central Kalassar and the Posaran Sea, respectively, and perhaps the disappearance of the ability to teleport, made them quite unhappy with the mismanagement of the region. So when the commander of the legions, Parpelissus Brutallus heard of the merchant consortium, he took the job and planned the rebellion.\nNonnus Andrenicus, the governor of Baraon, was able to raise an army of Sarmatian mercenaries with a payment of a 200 gold tribute, and a promise to allow them to settle in the area. The ensuing battle was brutal, and saw a large number of casualties on either side. Ultimately, the rebellion was a success, and was a catalyst for many more rebellions against Kalassarian authorities in the region. The food stores from the previous administration was not enough to sustain the population for long, however, but to Brutallus' credit, they were distributed to the populace at a somewhat orderly manner. Officers of the legion were given lands according to their merits in battle, and their staff were allowed to till the fields with tubers and other similarly hardy root crops.&nbsp;The Sarmatians who fought for Andrenicus were convinced to stand down by being offered commissions in the legions, parceled out and separated across the different Baraonian lands.&nbsp;The famine was still an issue, and so exports of food items and fertilizer were forbidden by decree of the new king. This allowed for domestic food stores to be barely enough for the population. Disease and death by hunger were still a daily occurrence though reportedly alleviated. The former, however, was managed by setting up quarantine colonies separated from the rest of the general populace. They were often staffed by followers of Pomona who had volunteered to care for the sick.&nbsp;\nAftermath🔗\nThe immediate aftermath of the Baraonian rebellion was the separation of the other Hapgarian regions from the rest of the Kalassar. The most accessible passes to Central Kalassar were no longer available, after Parpelissus forcibly closed the borders. Sea routes in the south were blockaded by the well-equipped Ahurian navies. Mountain ranges that peppered the northern coasts of Central Kalassar forced sea routes through the pirate-infested Menean Sea to get to connect with [location:188] in the Poasan region. In the immediate decades hence, the northern Hapgarian regions kept the facade of being a part of the Kalassar still, with positions and institutions named similarly, their functions slowly drifted to meet different demands of each locality. Further internal and external pressures would then fracture even these hollow shells eventually and would further fragment into the other Apgarian Kingdoms. Once the dust settles from the tumult of the 5th century, the map of Betera would shift one step closer to the world we know and understand. The western portion of the Kalassar, was no more in all but name--those vestigial institutions in northern Hapgaria were no longer truly under the thumb of the Kalassarian Emperor in Bastion though they remain.\n\n1\nInstantaneous Magical Travel in the Kalassar\n2: Tandoor Migration\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/world-novelty/on-the-fall-of-the-western-kalassarian-empire/","path":"/world-novelty/on-the-fall-of-the-western-kalassarian-empire/","title":"On the Fall of the Western Kalassarian Empire and the Formation of the Pre-Apgarian Kingdoms"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/world-novelty/parpelissian-journal/":{"body":"Translated from Classical Parpelissian by Narmaya\n25th Day of the First Month of 870🔗\nThe seas are quite calm today, and so, after a month of this voyage, I finally am able to document our misadventure in this journal daddy has given me as a gift.\nUp until now, my constitution had not withstood the tossing and turning of the Sarmatian Sea along the coast of Estrega, as we headed north through the Tears, into the fjords of Snowden.
