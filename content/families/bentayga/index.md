The _Bentayga_ clan is a close-knit family of ethnically [Parpelissian](@/ethnicities/parpelisse.md) sailors who have come to spread across the islands on the [Harmatian Sea](@/locations/harmatian-sea.md). They are renowned to be natural seafarers and navigators that they 
are highly sought after by shipping companies, smugglers, privateers and navies around
the known world.

A disproportionate number of them have moved into Raibon Island and intermarried with 
some of the prominent families on the island.
