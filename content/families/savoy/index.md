_The House of Savoy of Rainoso_ are a family of soldiers, support staff and crew, who
mostly serve at the pleasure of the [Bouillard](@/families/bouillard.md) Family. The
family itself were rooted from original settlers from [Estrega](@/locations/estrega.md)
when they first moved into [Raibon Island](@/locations/raibon-island.md).

# Pater Familius
The entire Savoy clan, including its branches answer to a _Pater Familius_, the father
of the family. Usually, but not always, the title is bestowed upon the eldest male of 
the main branch of the family. This form of primogeniture was more common before the
various [Apgarian Revolutions](@/event/apgarian-revolution.md), and it may be that this
was a hold-over from those ways. It is unclear, however if House Savoy was once a 
[Noble House](@/misc/noble-houses-of-apgar.md).

The Pater Familius was, and is in charge of family gatherings, resolving inter-familial
squabbles, etc. In the present day, the Pater Familius also is the primary protector
of the leader of the _Bouillard_ family.

# Bouillard "Vassalage"
The House Savoy declared themselves protectors of the Bouillards after 
[Parvese slavers](@/families/parvese.md) have kidnapped the scions of its main
branch. [Lemuel Savoy](@/characters/lemuel-savoy.md), who was next in line to be
_Pater Familius_ was captured and tortured during the attempt to rescue his sisters
from _Parvese_ hands.

[Romulus Bouillard](@/characters/romulus-bouillard.md) spearheaded a number of ships,
led by his flagship [The Black Quill](@/organizations/the-black-quill.md), to intercept
the _Parvese_ ships holding the prospective slaves. The rescue was a success, and the
Savoys, along with many others, were returned to the island. The Parvese denied any involvement with the matter, but it was plain to the Bouillards
that they were in charge of that operation.

As thanks, Lemuel declared that as soon as he received the position of _Pater Familius_,
he would declare themselves protectors of the Bouillard family for eternity. The family
had been serving for _five generations_ as of this writing.

# Monroe Savoy's Leadership
As was tradition, the position of _Pater Familius_ was conferred to the eldest male
of the family, but as Lemuel neared death, his children unanimously decided to award
the honor to his second child [Monroe Savoy](@/characters/monroe-savoy.md) due to
his marriage with Romulus' daughter [Nathalie Bouillard](@/characters/nathalie-bouillard.md). The idea was eldest son [Madison Savoy's](@/characters/madison-savoy.md), who did not
relish the responsibility that the position brought.

Monroe spearheaded many of the professional underpinnings of the Savoys, bringing to
order the [Savoy training compound](@/location/savoy-training-compound.md) in [Port Rainoso's East Side](@/locations/port-rainoso.md#east-side).

# Naim's Resentment
Not everyone was happy with the transition of power to Monroe's lineage however.
[Naim Savoy](@/characters/naim-savoy.md) in particular, resented is father from
relinquishing the position. It was reported that Naim wanted the position to
steer the family away from the role of servitude from the Bouillards that everyone
else seemed to have accepted so easily. The resentment was also shared by his
wife [Portencia](@/characters/portencia-bentayga.md), as she was shared Bouillard
blood being a [Bentayga](@/families/bentayga/index.md), and thought that they'd deserved more.
