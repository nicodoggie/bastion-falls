The Savoy family is a "vassal" family of the \[family:175|Bouillards\]. The members of the Savoy family are trained at a young age to act as guards, spies, assassins and accountants, all to fulfill the needs of the Boulliard family in whatever capacity is necessary for them. As to why the Savoys are so subservient is anyone's guess. Most say it was to fulfill a blood-debt in the days of the \[event:80\], but no one is quite so sure if it has any truth in it, or what the circumstances that led to it if it was.
