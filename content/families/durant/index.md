The Durant family originally hail from mainland [Sanery](@/locations/sanery.md)
and were staunch anti-Masochist. During the [Battles for the Masochist](@/misc/battles-for-the-masochist.md) in the 1100s that made the [de la Fouet](@/families/de-la-fouet.md) 
family famous, the Durants, amongst others moved to 
[Raibon Island](@/locations/raibon-island.md) in protest. The thought was, that
they would eventually mount a counter-offensive to suppress the Masochistas in 
the mainland. They ultimately failed to mount any sort of resistance, as fielding
soldiers proved difficult.

Most present-day Durants are still of the [Apgarian Paganist](@/religions/apgarian-paganism.md) persuasion, with notable exceptions being a branch who
had married into the [McFarland](@/families/mcfarland.md) family, as they follow 
[Northern Paganist](@/religions/northern-paganism.md) traditions.
