The first portion of this campaign would be in the [Alsatian Mountains](@/locations/alsatian-mountains.md), a long mountain range that extends throughout the entirety of the [Apgarian](@/locations/apgar.md) [province of Alsace](@/locations/alsace.md). The player characters involved are the following:

 - Bartholomew IV Strandiz
 - Emily Hazeldine
 - Narmaya
 - Levallier de la Fouet

These two pairs have separate ultimate goals as they head into the town of [Hugo](@/locations/hugo.md). The former are merely travelling into the Mountains via the doorway that connects it with the [Turbiere de Hubar](@/locations/turbiere-de-hubar.md) in order to quickly head into [Mayonne](@/locations/mayonne.md), where supposedly the soulless body of [Matthew V Strandiz](@/characters/matthew-v-strandiz.md) is wandering. The latter are in search for another vampire who supposedly once resided in these mountains. Collectively, during the Hugo portion of the campaign, the party would have an average party level of 10, which would be tough to prepare for in a lower magic setting.

To further complicate issues, currently, Bart Strandiz is in the Feywild, and travelling from that plane to Thera causes random temporal shifting to occur. The randomness has to be accounted for, as there are certain world events with fixed dates. As it relates to this particular campaign, [Phantasmagoria](@/events/hantasmagoria.md) is set to happen on the 13th day of the 9th month. EV said that in case the rolls were so bad, the other three might want to head to Hugo even before Strandiz would come back from the feywild. This is because Phantasmagoria might be one of the only venues where they could find clues on the vampire they're looking for, and also taking even more time than what has already elapsed since the [Free Theater](@/organizations/free-theater.md) had disposed of Matthey Strandiz' body may decrease the chances that they would be able to find him.

# Current State of Things

## Hugo

Currently, the Hags of Hama and La Camaraderie jointly hold the "doorway" that connects [Raibon Island](@/locations/raibon-island.md) with [Walburton House]("@/locations/walburton-house.md) in Hugo. They routinely ensure that any [Reformist](@/religions/reformed-divine-masochist.md) agents are not able to retake control and send more people into Raibon Island. There were some Reformist scouts that have been sent to the area recently, who were easily dealt with, and subsequently transformed into Frogmen by members of the Hags of Hama.

But in the run-up to Phantasmagoria, with more people have been entering the area, it is becoming harder to track new arrivals and confirm whether or not they are Reformists. Within the past month, the various inns and taverns, as well as some personal homes, people from various parts of Apgar, Poasah, Mehicania, Tanduaria, Calamutz, Ahuria and even from as far East as [Sarebia](@/locations/sarebia.md) and [Haram](@/locations/haram.md). These foreigners and their various motivations and prejudices don't necessarily jive well with each other, and had begun to cause some tensions in the area. Not even to say whether or not some of them may be Reformist agitators.

### Factions at play
 - La Camaraderie
 - Hags of Hama
 - Reformists
 - The Thirteen
 - Devotees of the Angel of Nature
 - Vampires of Alsace

#### La Camaraderie and the Hags of Hama

The fact that Somme Privatea was given an invitation to the auction at Wunderplat Hospital at all was due to rumors that La Camaraderie might have been attempting to bolster their numbers with spellcasters outside of Apgar's official sphere of influence. Illuvia Wunderplat herself knew that Raibon Island might actually be fertile ground for spellcasters to develop, and so wished to see how far along they've gotten, if they have gotten anything at all. being one of Phantasmagoria's largest sponsors, she used a ticket to the secret magical event to probe what they knew at the time.

# Why

To actually prep for this game, let's dig in to the various motivations that led to the current state the entities involved are in.

## Why was Matthew V Strandiz' soul taken?

## Why was his body dumped in Mayonne? Why might it actually still be there?
