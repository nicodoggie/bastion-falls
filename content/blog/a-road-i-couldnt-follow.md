I walked a road I couldn't follow\
In a daze and hollow\
Didn't know left from right\
And as I walk I wallow\

I came across a house I wouldn't enter\
Its door was off-kilter\
I ran my damn mouth\
Dismantling my own filter\

I stopped upon a bridge I didn't cross\
Stared at that drop across\
Deciding in that moment\
That this was a lousy cause\

So I walked off the road I couldn't follow\
Off that bridge of woe\
Into that house of madness\
And made peace with my sorrow\

And maybe I was a coward\
But maybe I turned brave
