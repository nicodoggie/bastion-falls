The edge of the desk beneath my shaky fingers\
Tapping nervously with a furious emotion that lingers\
Blazing at a hundred words per minute\
Just trying my best to wing it

But it all comes crashing\
The interface keeps hanging\
As the screen blares blue\
Hexes dropping in the monotone hue\

Staying frozen past reboot\
Can't even fix it as root

It's time to shutdown\
Sorry I let you down\
Just going through a little meltdown\
Playlist roaring some motown

It's not that I want not\
It's more like, I cannot\
For some reason, things just would not\
Feels like I'm in a knot
