+++

I am a workhorse, plying and infinite field
Farmed out by masters to reap a digital yield
Toiling bit-by-bit, day-by-day
For gains in which, I'll have no sway
Until the rust wears out my shoe
And then they render my bones for glue
A limp workhorse then, less than manure
Whose care those masters would not endure
Unless I can continue to provide
I will not be worth my hide
Nothing to be left, not even pride
A workhorse.
Ragged and hoarse
Soon dead and forgotten
As a matter of course
