title = "Konti Kirsharti: Those Who Serve Beside"
+++

Beyond their forbear's transgressions\
They've become above\
No longer unruly and rebellious\
An epiphanous understanding wells\
Within their very soul\

They are then to be mandated accepted\
Within their masters' homes\
No longer chattel to be traded\
Cherished as your own\
Their shackles shed from their wrists\

They are to be an extension of your body\
They are become your arms\
When you need more than two\
They are become your legs\
For when you need alactrity\

They are your Konti Kirsharti\
They serve at your side\
To do as you will\
But to be beloved where you reside\
This is the mandate of your Lord
