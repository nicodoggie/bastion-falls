title = "The Rose of Manascula Cannot Smile"
+++

The Manasculan Rose\
Our Queen of the Hedge\
Upon her throne, arose\
She looms on her ledge\

Subjects themselves prostrate\
Admiring her crown\
Wondering on her fate\
Fawning on her gown\

From above, vultures swoop\
Circling her with glee\
Descending to her stoop\
As the subjects flee\

Behind her fronds hides her thorns\
So she cannot smile\
She stares with haughty scorn\
So none see her guile\

By herself, she did fight\
While hiding her might\
As those birds take their flight\
Her eyes, they grew bright\

But sharp were their talons\
And though she was strong\
She fell between canyons\
With nary a song\

The Manasculan Rose\
Seed astrewn for miles\
Someday reap what she sows\
That she someday, smiles
