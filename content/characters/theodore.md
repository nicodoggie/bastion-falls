Theodore was an agent of the Apgarian military. He worked under an intelligence-focused sub-unit under the direct command of [Major General Michael V Strandiz](@/characters/michael-v-strandiz.md).

Theodore had been under the control of [Hedwig Rosa Rosenkrantz](@/characters/hedwig-rosenkrantz.md) with the use of a magical Parpelissian journal that gave the ability to strongly suggest a command upon a target person.

He had provided very little relevant information even under the influence. Recently, Theodore was found dead near the dead drop point that [Somme Privatea](@/characters/somme-privatea.md) had used to keep communication with the man.

His body was taken into the custody of the local gendarmerie.
