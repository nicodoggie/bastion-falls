_Seraphine Durant née Gognon_ was the daughter of [Estregan](@/locations/estrega.md) politician, [Emile Gognon](@/characters/emile-gognon.md), and
wife to [Port Rainoso](@/locations/port-rainoso.md) vice-mayor [Degare Durant](@/characters/degare-durant.md). She is not very well-known in the
public eye, as she tends to shy away from the spotlight that is usually shone upon her family and their accomplishments. 

She is quite known to be the quiet type, oft letting her husband do most of the talking, while she brings food or beverages to their guests, despite
there being servants around to do the same.

Her marriage to Durant caused quite a stir. Aside from the fact that Durant's ex-wife [Elodië Durant née Bentayga](@/characters/elodie-bentayga.md) died a less than a month prior, but also due to the fact the the [Durant family](@/families/durant.md) was once staunchly anti-Masochist, and the [Gognons](@/families/gognon.md) were one of the most devout in Estrega. However, Degare's branch who inter-married with the [Iutlandish](@/locations/iutland.md) [McFarlands](@/families/mcfarland.md) were not as aggressive in their stance as those of the main one from [Sanery](@/locations/sanery.md).
