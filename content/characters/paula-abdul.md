{{ incomplete ()}}

Born Paulina Guildenstern, was one of the most famous Apgarian theater performers of all time. She was one of the proponents of the 
[Naturalist Movement](@/misc/naturalist-movement.md) of Theatre in Apgar, and a member fo the famous 
[Guildenstern Travelling Troupe](@/organizations/guildenstern-travelling-troupe.md). However, due to a number of controversies, most notably 
the [Garatonian Aubergine Landgrab](@/events/garatonian-aubergine-landgrab.md), her membership was revoked.

She continued to remain popular despite the issues, as the popularity of the realistic depictions of the world that the naturalist movement portrayed in their productions.
She moved to [Sanery](@/locations/sanery.md) in part to avoid the Guildensterns, and in part to be closer to friend and collaborator [Helene Nise](@/charaters/helene-nise.md).

# Leader of the Free Theater
During a tour of [Mayonne](@/locations/mayonne.md), she met [Andrei Delarde](@/characters/andrei-delarde.md). who was drawn to her natural charisma. He was entranced by
her capability of "changing faces" with every new performance, despite lacking the ability to cast magic. They eventually collaborated on a number of productions, including some
that they had used to extract a large amount of capital from a number of investors.

Eventually, some of her controversies had caught up with her while she was in Mayonne as one business magnate had threatened to expose her, if she did not cut him into their
profits. She agreed to their terms, but had made a plan with Delarde to bring them into the play and kill him on-stage, pretending that it was all an act. Then Delarde would
use magic to stage an accident after the fact. From then on, they performed a number of contract killings on stage.

They would expand their operations after they attract [Alfred Panet](@/characters/alfred-panet.md) due to the novel ways they kill.
