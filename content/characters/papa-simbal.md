Renier de Pardieu Simbal, or more commonly known as, Papa Simbal, is a self-styled shaman who operates a fortune-telling business in the outskirts of [Le Phar√© Phallique](@/locations/le-phare-phallique.md) in the western portion of [Raibon Island](@/locations/raibon-island.md). He was exposed as a charlatan right before he perished of mysterious circumstances on a ship bound for [Sanery](@/locations/sanery.md).
