The man is an enigma. He works with the [Parvèse](@/families/parvese.md) as a "procurement" manager. He recruits new talent for their shows, and some of their other. less savory activities.

Most who have seen him simply describe him as a man with an eyepatch and a peg-leg. He plays into the pirate stereotype when he "procures" his "goods" for [Rosemunda](@/characters/rosemunda-parvese.md). He doesn't really have a reason for the eyepatch aside from this. The peg-leg, he usually hides in a specially-made shoe most of the time. On a regular day, he would be passed over as an unremarkable man in one of the Parvèse casinos.
