# Introduction

Sturgeon or Nadaja is an Ahurian male, born in [Manascula](@/locations/manascula.md), a slim man with brown skin, yellow-ish eyes and short wavy hair which he dyes brown, his upper body is covered with tattoos. He is the middle child of a [Provobati](/religions/ahore#provobati) couple Himedere and Ishtara, who owns a small ship repair business "Himedere ship repairs" in Manascula. 

When Nadaja was 12 yrs old his Father suffered a heart attack and died, leaving Ishtara to man their family business. Nadaja's older brother is [Hadkaha](@/characters/hadkaha.md), a you$$ng cartographer who travels a lot because of his Job. He has a younger sister named [Endora](@/characters/endora.md) who likes martial arts and frequents underground tournaments disguised as a young man (Karma). Nadaja is the only one among the siblings to actually like his familyâ€™s trade. 

One night, Endora failed to return home after an underground fight. The family spent most of their fortune hiring mercenaries and investigators to look for the 16 yrs old Endora to no avail. Hadkaha traversed the sea to also look for clues while Nadaja goes to underground fights from town to town to find her. After 4 years his Mother decided to move on but both older siblings were still dedicated to finding Endora.
