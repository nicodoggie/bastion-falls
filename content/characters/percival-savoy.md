Percival Savoy was once the leader of the {{ fam(name="Savoy" )}} family's {{ org(name="Patrol Group", slug="savoy-patrol-group") }}. 

{% spoilers() %}
Percival was the mastermind of the [Savoy Coup d'etat](@/events/savoy-coup.md) against
the leadership of the Savoy family and the [Bouillard](@/families/bouillard.md) 
organization. He ordered a shipment of illicit drugs from [Mehicania](@/locations/mehicania.md)
to be sent to [Senera](@/locations/senera.md), then tipped off the [Port Tressemer](@/locations/port-tressemer.md) law-enforcement authority, the [Peacekeepers](@/organizations/peacekeepers.md), that Bouillard ships were bringing in drugs. The Peacekeepers found the drugs, then
filed a case against the Bouillard Organization, and [Nicollete Bouillard](@/characters/nicolette-bouillard.md) herself.
