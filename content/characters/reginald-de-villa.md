Reginald de Villa is an elected Draft Councilor in \[location:97\]. He is a 5th generation resident from the prominent \[race:114\] de Villa clan of merchants.

As of 1275, he is serving his 2nd term as Draft Councilor, and is up for re-election in the next calendar year.  

He runs on a platform of island self-sufficiency. The idea is that Rainoso, and by extension, Raibon, should be able to feed itself in the case that some cataclysm might happen that would disrupt trade and commerce. He is a proponent of bringing in more investors to farm the land.

He is also a proponent of perhaps extracting peat from the \[location:122\]and export it as fuel for Sanery's lamp-lighting industry.
