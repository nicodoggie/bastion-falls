Rolf Prichard de la Fouet is the second of three de la Fouet children born after the \[event:103\].

His father considered Rolf to be the family's shame due to the fact that he had yellow eyes and a streak of yellow hair--traits that did not exist in the de la Fouet family line. In other words, he was suspected to have been born out of a non-existent affair. In reality, the yellow coloring on his eyes and hair were mark of his ability to cast magic. But even this was a mark of the family's shame. The de la Fouet famliy was well-known for their history as devoutly\[organisation:79|Divine Masochist\], with their foremost ancestor credited with fighting for it in the old Kingdom of Sanery. Practice of magic was forbidden by the Church hierarchy as anathema, so having a child with that stain only "proved" the sinful nature of his birth.

Growing up, Rolf often looked to his elder brother, \[character:81|Levallier\] for guidance and inspiration on how he would redeem himself in his father's eyes. This led him to joining the \[event:105\] in 1235. The second attempt in liberating the remainder of Burtz from the grip of the warlords and the \[organisation:106\] that practically ruled the area. The members of the crusade were never heard from again. Not even a fragment of a wreakage was seen or spotted--not even charlatans attempted to claimed to have survived the event. Rolf, of course, disappeared with the rest of them.
