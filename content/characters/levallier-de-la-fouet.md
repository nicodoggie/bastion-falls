{{ incomplete() }}

_Father Levallier de la Fouet_ was a priest of the [Orthodox Church of the Divine Masochist](@/religions/orthodox-divine-masochist.md), and a member of the venerable [House de la Fouet](@/families/de-la-fouet.md). He was said to have been next in line to become the _Archbishop of Sanery_, the largest
Bishopric in the [Apgarian Confederacy](@/locations/apgar.md), but had instead chosen to be granted a position as the parish priest of the [Church of the Angel of Justice](@/locations/church-of-the-angel-of-justice.md), an under-served and understaffed parish in [Port Rainoso](@/locations/port-rainoso.md), [Raibon Island](@/locations/raibon-island.md).

He is a tall, usually gaunt, man, and is often described as older than he appears, 
but his appearance immediately turns imposing once roused to anger.
# Early Career
He took the assignment to this problematic little parish after years in one of the more prestigious churches in \[location:17\] ostensibly to wind down after a somewhat tumultuous career in establishing the right to worship a religion that is usually associated with many of the enemies of the \[location:10|Apgarian Confederacy\].

He had, during his short tenure as parish priest in Rainoso, grown its membership to 50 families. a little over 3 times its previous size in a community that was once very hostile to the Church. He had done so by engaging with villages and homesteads outside of the port town, in the rest of \[location:98\].

He is the elder brother of \[character:82\], captain of the privateer vessel \[organisation:84\].
