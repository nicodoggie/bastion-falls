Father Levallier de la Fouet is the parish priest of the \[organisation:79|Divine Masochist\] \[location:96\] in \[location:97\], and under-served and understaffed parish. He took the assignment to this problematic little parish after years in one of the more prestigious churches in \[location:17\] ostensibly to wind down after a somewhat tumultuous career in establishing the right to worship a religion that is usually associated with many of the enemies of the \[location:10|Apgarian Confederacy\].

He had, during his short tenure as parish priest in Rainoso, grown its membership to 50 families. a little over 3 times its previous size in a community that was once very hostile to the Church. He had done so by engaging with villages and homesteads outside of the port town, in the rest of \[location:98\].

He is the elder brother of \[character:82\], captain of the privateer vessel \[organisation:84\].
