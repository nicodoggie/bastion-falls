Rosamunda Parvèse is the matriarch of the [Parvèse family](@/families/parvese.md) and runs a number of establishments in the red-light district of [East Side of Port Rainoso](@/locations/port-rainoso.md#east-side), collectively called the [Houses of Pleasures](@/organizations/parvese-houses-of-pleasures.md). 

The middle-aged Rosemunda had brought her beleaguered family from near-extinction at the hands of a once significant group with a vendetta against her father. She now personally owns a sizable portion of the East Side, and owns, or at least has a finger in, many of the establishments in Rainoso's bugeoning red-light district. She also has an acute sense of the carnal pleasures, and a unique ability to find new and exciting diversions. 

Her Houses of Pleasure have drawn  [L'Illes Apgarie](@/locations/l-illes-apgarie.md)'s rich and powerful to her menagerie. These, along with her strong business-sense and uncompromising nature, are why many consider her one of the [Four Pillars of the East Side](@/organizations/four-pillars-of-the-east-side.md).
