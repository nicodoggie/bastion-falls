Welcome to Kanka! Your first campaign has been created and we have included a couple of example entities as inspiration (you can delete them whenever).  
  
You'll probably want to get started by adding some entities of your own, so chose a category from the left and get started. You can disable unneeded categories of entity from the campaign settings, this will hide them from the menu.  
  
A few tips to get you started:  
\- You can type @entityName to link to specific entities. The displayed link text will automatically update if you rename or update the linked entity.  
\- You can configure account specific settings like themes and entities per page in your profile, accessible on the top right.  
\- You can set permissions on whole entity types as well as individually on each entity.  
\- There is a growing list of tutorials on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwb3pl0LOlxd3GvMPAXIEog/videos). Tutorials include attributes and how to share your campaign with other people. The [FAQ](https://campaigns.home.thekennel.info/en-US/faq) may also be useful.  
  
Last but not least:  
\- Have a look at [Public Campaigns](https://campaigns.home.thekennel.info/en-US/public-campaigns) for inspiration on how others use Kanka.  
\- If you have questions, suggestions or just want to chat, join us on [Discord](//discord.gg/rhsyZJ4).
