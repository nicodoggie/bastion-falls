# Potential reformist in Quinn Pratt's employ

# Who is the Savoy "Rat"

# What was Otto Savoy protecting? What did the Deathengel want?

Avis?

# If Avis was the reason why Otto died, why then did the Deathengel not try to take Avis?

Because the creature that the Deathengel occupied did not have the capability.

# What is preventing the Deathengel from directly assaulting yet?

Something with the *Nexus Point*?

# How many can the Planetar take control of? Why? Why no direct moves into the Bog/Town of Hama?
