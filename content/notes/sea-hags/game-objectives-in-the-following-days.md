A few more hours in Racos Palma
-------------------------------

### Livery upgrades for the Rozenmaiden

One of the stated reasons for using the \[organisation:110\] on their trip to \[location:119\] is \[character:82|Jean-Paul's\] suggestion to employ some of the smuggler-shipwrights' construction techniques for hiding and switching livery at a moment's notice. It would cost them about a day or two on the island depending on the scale of the construction, and so we might as well find some things to do on the island in the meanwhile. We need things to be able to do in the island.

#### Beach

The beaches of Racos Palma during off-peak seasons are nearly empty, due to the often chilling northern temperatures. Any other time of day but 11 am to 2 pm would usually be too cold to bathe, especially in the fall and winter months. Locals do have a festival celebrating the bounties of the sea before winter, with most rituals done in the various ports and beaches of the island.

When there aren't a lot of people though, locals scour the beaches for items that are washed ashore, like messages in bottles and other such things.  

#### Hospital Transfer of Control

There might be some people who have issues with \[organisation:83\] taking control of the hospital, no matter how minimally-invasive their management might be. It would be unlikely that the \[location:14|Mehicanian\] government would not place agents considering their significant investment in \[character:131\]'s research. For sure this agent would be attempting to escape the island undetected. There must be some chance for the players to catch this character as they inspect the smugglers' ports.  

#### Smugglers Try to Cut Into the Deal

Smugglers would definitely try to capitalize on the sudden power vacuum that the death of \[character:131\] represented. How they would capitalize on it would depend on the player. They might find out about the Mehicanian agent trying to escape, and help them in exchange for some concessions or benefits. The smugglers might also try to negotiate some sort of deal with \[character:113|Somme\], and \[organisation:83\] to get some sort of preferential treatment or trade deal. Likely, a lot of different smuggler groups would act on all of these at the same time as they vie for a bigger piece of the pie, so to speak.  

#### Ministry of the Occult Try to Figure Things Out

The events in the hospital definitely intrigue the \[organisation:107\]. The Empress, their representative, took notice of Cotto who was sa Cornups. She had only ever heard of the Cornups, and their probable connection to the hells, but she had never actually seen one, or actually have read more contemporary literature aboout them.
