# Carmen, the Reformist in Quinn's midst

# Who is the Savoy "Rat"

Leaning towards Rick Savoy right now. The accounts were to throw off the scent from himself.
He was working with Alejandro Machado, until right before he died. These are for the same reasons as Percival. He was able to keep himself clean tho, as he worked in the background. However he could have been the one to redirect some of the guards from the Bouillard Residence before the actual siege.



# What was Otto Savoy protecting? What did the Deathengel want?

Avis. At the time especially, the Reformists were making their presence known. He was to keep away from them, but Avis' presence needed some inspection

# If Avis was the reason why Otto died, why then did the Deathengel not try to take Avis?

Because the creature that the Deathengel occupied did not have the capability.

# What is preventing the Deathengel from directly assaulting yet?

The Reformists were actively trying to capture, or hamper him in some way. 

# What records did they want in Apgarian National Bank?

# How many can the Planetar take control of? Why? Why no direct moves into the Bog/Town of Hama?
