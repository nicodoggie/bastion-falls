The real [Quiver](@/characters/chang-quiver.md) is actually alive, but the bad guy is Mao.

Mao:
 - An adventurer that travelled the Feydark
 - Fell into worship of Malabog, king of the Fomorians
 - Returned last year, pretended to be good
 - Doppelganger
 - Brought magic items
   - Dolls: Clothilda, Mathilda and Beauty
   - The dolls were actually *Night Hags*, who intended to setup slavery from within [Jing Shen Jiang](@/locations/jing-shen-jiang.md) into [New Sharandar](@/;ocations/new-sharandar.md).
 - Brother of Yumei, deceased lover of [Winnifer](@/characters/chang-winnifer.md)
 - Used his sister's death to be able to investigate the [Cave of the Sleeping Serpent](@/locations/cave-of-the-sleeping-serpent.md)
 - Copied Quiver's face as a mask

The Real Quiver:
 - was captured but only because he was protecting an infant
 - He was using a *life transferrence* spell to keep the baby alive.
 - Found out Mao was copying his face to do shit, so he had to be dealt with

Ai:
 - She saw Mao dealing with Quiver, while he was carrying a baby
 - She tried to interfere to save the baby
 - Mao cast a *thunderwave* spell that pushed her into the water. She surged.

They return to Iskandar via a teleportation circle from Mournhearst. It seems to be hidden in some large pantry. After a number of corridors, they find themselves in front of an old woman. In a room with a floating sun. This is a Chapel of Wonders. The old lady is Madame dela Ponte's sister, Madame Catherine.


Madame dela Ponte wants us to help transport some girls that need saving from slavery within Iskandar. They are to be brought to Lavona Outpost.
