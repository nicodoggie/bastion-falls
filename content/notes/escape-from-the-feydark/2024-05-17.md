Ivariel thinks that Flyukishilla is bland. She seems to be gunning to be "the mayor's wife" and Demetrius as mayor. Thinks that the city needs more entertainment

Beron thinks the entertainment Ivariel provided was lacking.

Ingrid explains that it was lacking because of how the "entertainment" was done very quickly

Paulina doesn't know what the entertaiment is.

Ivariel is acting like some kind of royalty. She likes the tarts that Paulina serves...

Ivariel heard rumors that Paulina is some kind of whore

Ingrid thinks that more werewolves should have been sent

The "entertainment" is the killing of the people in the slums. She let loose the werewolf.

These fuckers are out for blood, killing innocents because they find them "revolting", Probably harboring "magic poisoning" victims.

Ivariel seems to be the "real power" behind Demetrius. Ingrid and Ivariel have a thing
