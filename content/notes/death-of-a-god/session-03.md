They leave the inn at Mile Marker 1 outside Port Piya, and travel for about five
hours until they arrive at a mining village within the lips of the mouth of the
Tahusa Valley. Caravans also pass through this village quite often, and use it
as a rest stop and had grown an industry around that fact. Fai, Prince Kolha,
Chari, Mat and Chian all play a game of cards, drawing things on the losers'
faces as they await their arrival.

They arrive, the caravans are ushered into an large empty field, the merchants,
and their retinue are unloaded onto an open-air cafeteria, where they eat lunch.

Fai excuses herself to explore the area, and looks around in the mercenary area,
not knowing what she would find. She stumbles upon a burly, bald man who tries
to flirt with her. The guy is a member of the Gentlemanly Band of Mercenaries.
While the man was flirting, there was a kid about the age or Chari, or younger,
who was looking onto the Kolhas' cargo, with the intent to overcome the single
guard, and then steal from its contents.

The attempt was overly risky, and not well thought-out, but the kid was able to
run due to Fai's interruption. A couple of hidden archers took aim at the kid's
pursuers, and was able to hit a man's leg. The kid was able to run away,
empty-handed, but unharmed.

Fai talked to the man who was guarding their cargo. It happened to be Creamy. He
said he was taken by surprise. He would not do so again, with such bluster. He
was, however, embarrassed by their company leader, who had him do 500 push-ups.

Mat had finally found Fai, Chari in tow, as they headed back to the cafeteria
area. They soon leave.

They arrive at the Little Spring Inn at about 6pm, right before dinner. 

They eat, Prince Kolha, once again eats with the rest of the merchants. They
take notice fo a quiet man named Daniel Browning, who barely speaks.

Chari wants to do something with Fai. Fai then visits the Pleasure staff, and
chooses a pleasure servant for her sister's first sexual experience. She fins
one only a few years older than she was. A boy named Lahren.
