### To Iris

> Iris, update on your current location.

< We are on our way to Grand Monastery. I have some bad news.

a Dolo-Dolo woman near the gate

friend?

< An army of Dolo-Dolo is on their way to Stairway by tomorrow noon
to attack

> Iris, this is alarming, what should we do?\

< Contact Yanara. I instructed Danere to go to her. She has to meet 
him somewhere nearby. Within an hour.

> You need something else, Iris?

< Contact Mari and Chian. We need to move soon.

### To Yanara

> Yanara, Danere and Dolo-Dolo woman are on their way to you. Meet

< WHAT?! Why? I'll be outside then.

> Yanara, I'll contact you and ask for an update every fifteen minutes.

< Ok

### To Mari

### To Chian

> Chian, you have to prepare the Prince to take over. News of Dolo-Dolo
  tribe marching towards Stairway. They'll be here by tomorrow noon.

< Very concerning. Will tell her ASAP. Should I take this to meam that 
  operation to rescue Piraha is in trouble?

> the name and the message.

< Understood. For now nothing. Will get back to you in 15 minutes. Take care of yourselves
  BTW, is Fai alright?

< Then I would not want to distract her for the moment. I'll ask about these sensitive
  topics later.


### To Mari

### To Mat

> Can I borrow that small statue of a shield? I will lend it to Mari for the Prince's protection

< You know where it is?

> I have a guess, I just want to ask first

< Go ahead. We don't know what it does exactly, as of yet. But from Darla, we at least know it isn't
  cursed. 

> Gravy will identify it with Darla, thanks.

< Ok. Things are progressing well here. We are currently riding towards, I think, the Grand Monastery.

> I am updating Mari with our plans by Iris's request.

  ourselves at this time.

# Sturgeon's Curse shows more detail

Whenever Sturgeon sneezes they are transformed into a sex opposite her current state.

In order to undo the curse while female, she has to receive semen within her vaginal
cavity 500 times with the same person. Any time a new person ejaculates within her 
vaginal cavity, the counter resets to 1.

If she does not receive ejaculate for a month in the described manner, she has disadantage
on constitution saving throws to regain her other form.

...

This curse may not be lifted by such trivial spells such as remove curse or greater restoration.

# Plate of the Task Master

Create an illusory task master in the form of a creature that a person of your choice within 60 ft radius
of the plate fears the most. You must mamke a wisdom saving throw or be haunted by the illusory
creature giving you commands.
