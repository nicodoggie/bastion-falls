The Frogmen were said to have been once the dead of the island. In those days, the people of the island buried their dead in the inner pools of the bog. The Hags asked the people to allow them to raise these bodies so they may protect them from interlopers. When the people agreed, the Hags had chosen to hide their faces to spare the citizens of the pain that may be caused by seeing their loved ones have no recognition of who they were. They took inspiration from the many frogs in the bog, which could breathe both on land and in water. Thus the Frogmen were born.
