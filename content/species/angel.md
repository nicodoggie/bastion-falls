Angels are powerful winged humanoids from the Celestial Planes, often considered beings of condensed goodly virtue. Legends from even the pagan religions often tell tales of angels who serve as messengers, attendants or adjudicators of gods. They do not traverse the planes for trivial pursuits. Often when they leave the Celestial Planes, they do so on a divine mission from their master.

Not a lot is known about angels, and the records that do exist are very hyperbolic in their description that authenticity or accuracy is questionable. What most descriptions have in common, aside from their white-feathered wings, is that they radiate a brilliant, blinding light on command. That their visage is enough to demand only truth be spoken in their presence.

# Divine Masochists: The Prime Angels and the Fallen
The [Divine Masochists](@/organizations/orthodox-divine-masochist.md) believe that the [Divine](@/characters/divine-masochist.md) himself created the first angel. In the Scripture of the Way, the [Book of Knimonad](@/religions/orthodox-divine-masochist/doctrine/knimonad.md) describes the order manner of their creation. It also describes a possible transformation of an angel into a devil, assuming the document is taken at face value. These angels were eventually called the Prime Angels religious scholars. Their Devil forms are also called the Prime Devils

| Angelic Form | Devilish Form |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Angel of Nature | Devil of Pestilence |
| Angel of Civilization | Devil of Hubris |
| Angel of Delight | Devil of Debauchery |
| Angel of Humility | Devil of Inhibition |
| Angel of Justice | Devil of Intolerance |

Scholars of Comparative Theology in the [University of Sanery](@/organizations/university-of-sanery.md) have asserted that the Prime Angels are so similar to the gods and goddesses of the Kalassarian Paganist, then the subsequent Apgarian Paganist rites because they were integrated by Kalassarian theologists in order to harmonize the beliefs in an attempt to ease the entirety of the empire to accept their new official religion. The lesser angels' roles were also similarly transplanted into the doctrine.

# Paganist Traditions

The descendants of the Kalassarian Paganist traditions, such as the [Apgarian Paganist Rite](@/religions/pagan/apgarian/_index.md) similarly assert that angels are servants to the gods. They employ legions of angels recruited from the [Celestial Planes](@/locations/celestial-planes.md) to do their bidding, for so as long as they are right. They do not have, in their lore, any reference to transformations of angels to devils. They only mention fallen angels, and enlightened devils in scenarios where the creatures have escaped their natures.
