Angels are powerful winged humanoids from the Celestial Planes, often considered beings of condensed goodly virtue. Legends from even the pagan religions often tell tales of angels who serve as messengers, attendants or adjudicators of gods. They do not traverse the planes for trivial pursuits. Often when they leave the Celestial Planes, they do so on a divine mission from their master.

Not a lot is known about angels, and the records that do exist are very hyperbolic in their description that authenticity or accuracy is questionable. What most descriptions have in common, aside from their white-feathered wings, is that they radiate a brilliant, blinding light on command. That their visage is enough to demand only truth be spoken in their presence.

# Religious Traditions

## Divine Masochists: The Prime Angels and the Fallen
The [Divine Masochists](@/organizations/orthodox-divine-masochist.md) believe that the [Divine](@/characters/divine-masochist.md) himself created the first angel. In the Scripture of the Way, the [Book of Knimonad](@/religions/divine-masochism/orthodox/doctrine/knimonad.md) describes the order manner of their creation. It also describes a possible transformation of an angel into a devil, assuming the document is taken at face value. These angels were eventually called the Prime Angels religious scholars. Their Devil forms are also called the Prime Devils

| Angelic Form          | Devilish Form        |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Angel of Nature       | Devil of Pestilence  |
| Angel of Civilization | Devil of Hubris      |
| Angel of Delight      | Devil of Debauchery  |
| Angel of Humility     | Devil of Inhibition  |
| Angel of Justice      | Devil of Intolerance |

Scholars of Comparative Theology in the [University of Sanery](@/organizations/university-of-sanery.md) have asserted that the Prime Angels are so similar to the gods and goddesses of the Kalassarian Paganist, then the subsequent Apgarian Paganist rites because they were integrated by Kalassarian theologists in order to harmonize the beliefs in an attempt to ease the entirety of the empire to accept their new official religion. The lesser angels' roles were also similarly transplanted into the doctrine.

## Paganist Traditions

The descendants of the Kalassarian Paganist traditions, such as the [Apgarian Paganist Rite](@/religions/paganism/apgarian/_index.md) similarly assert that angels are servants to the gods. They employ legions of angels recruited from the [Celestial Planes](@/locations/celestial-planes.md) to do their bidding, for so as long as they are right. They do not have, in their lore, any reference to transformations of angels to devils. They only mention fallen angels, and enlightened devils in scenarios where the creatures have escaped their natures.

# Ranks of Angels

The promotion of an angel to the next rank is called an *Ascension*. They are thought to progess by providing service to their lords, and receiving commendations for their works. It's believed that simply being told to *ascend* by a respected authority figure with conviction, they would instantly transform into their next form. 

## Deva

*Devas* are the lowest ranking angels that are sent to missions toward the various planes. Their mandate is to usually perform their tasks in the most subtle means which align with the morals of their lord. They are usually tasked to aid certain individuals or groups, but are not allowed to act on their behalf directly.

## Planetar

*Planetars* are considered weapons of their god. They are sent as a sort of deterrent to threats against their god or their god's followers. They have the divine power to immediately see througn any deception, magical or otherwise. They are able to act with more autonomy than a Deva, and may in fact command Devas that serve the same entity.

When miracles are performed in a god's name, it is usually through the intercession of a planetar.

## Solar

Not many is known about the existence of *Solars*, aside from what is referenced in pagan oral traditions. They are listed as to be of higher rank than the Planetars and act as stewards for their god, and that each god has a single Solar always at their side. They are speculated to have powers that include and extend past those of the ranks below.

# Angel Moral Alignment

It is unknown how angels come at their moral alignment, and become so deeply intwined with them that they follow every letter of them to a fault. They are considered to embody everything that is "good", but how "good" is interpreted can vary wildly across belief systems. For the most part, what the angel does consider good, aligns absolutety with a god's. For example, an angel of the [Reformed Church of the Divine Masochist](@/religions/divine-masochism/reformist/_index.md) may find it completely acceptable that they inflict flagellation on their members.
