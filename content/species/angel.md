Angels are powerful winged humanoids from the Celestial Planes, often considered beings of condensed goodly virtue. Legends from even the pagan religions often tell tales of angels who serve as messengers, attendants or adjudicators of gods. They do not traverse the planes for trivial pursuits. Often when they leave the Celestial Planes, they do so on a divine mission from their master.

Not a lot is known about angels, and the records that do exist are very hyperbolic in their description that authenticity or accuracy is questionable. What most descriptions have in common, aside from their white-feathered wings, is that they radiate a brilliant, blinding light on command. That their visage is enough to demand only truth be spoken in their presence.

# The Prime Angels and the Fallen

The [Divine Masochists](@/organizations/orthodox-divine-masochist.md) believe that the [Divine Masochist](@/characters/divine-masochist.md) himself created the first angel--the *Angel of Nature* to help him make the entirety of creation. With them, he made the planes, the stars, the planets, the plants and animals, then the people.

But at the time, the people were not much better than animals themselves. They were given the gift of intelligence, yes, but with the burden of survival, they could only do so much to progress. 

Then the Lord intermingled his essence with the hottest of the stars of the Angel of Nature's creation, then from its core was borne the *Angel of Civilization*. The Angel brought first the gift of fire, then the gift of agriculture, then finally the gift of magic.

But the people soon were changed by the gifts. Some abused them in order to gain more than what they needed. Others used guile and deceit to get ahead. Those that were left behind were left in despair and pain. Their manifest pride had grown beyond belief at the marvel of their works and forgot they themselves were given the gifts they use. But in their works the Angel of Civilization themself had been infected by their pride, and so the first devil came from the angel--the *Devil of Hubris*.

Their malice had infected the Angel of Nature, and they sought to destroy what they had worked hard to create. The infection had caused them to create locusts and the rust monsters, flies and the plagues. They have become the *Devil of Pestilence*.

To right these wrongs, the Divine Masochist gave more of his will, and created the *Angels of Virtue*. To combat *Hubris* he brought about the *Angel of Humility*. To fight against the darkness of *Pestilence*, come the *Angel of Delight*. Then to guide all to do what is right, he sent the *Angel of Justice*. And all was right with the world.

But soon even *Delight* had gone too far with the delight they offered, and soon became the *Devil of Debauchery*. As a reaction, the Angel of Humility railed against the debauchery but went too far, and became the *Devil of Inhibition*. Then, even the Angel of Justice could no longer tolerate the evils that people had inevitably brought. They doo have become infected and had become the *Devil of Intolerance*.

And then, when all was thought to be lost, and the world was consumed in strife, the Divine Masochist himself had come into the world. To take upon himself the burdens, and show that though it is difficult, through that adversity there can be joy. Through that destruction comes new life. After that malice, there can be restitution.
