*Vampires* are creatures that were once any humanoid species, then were infected by an unknown mechanism, usually by another vampire's blood. They exhibit supernatural abilities such as super-human strength, enhanced sensory capabilities, immortality, and flight, but are afflicted by extreme sunlight sensitivity, an irrational fear of running water, the inability to enter a house without explicit permission and an insatiable lust for blood, especially during full moons.

Vampires consume *life energy* usually in the form of blood. During the individual's transformation into vampirism, their canine teeth elongate and sharpen, that help penetrate skin.

It is theorized that Vampirism is actually a variation of a *Warlock Pact*, since a number of extant vampires have reported hearing a voice during their transformation.

# Forms

A vampire would have the ability to change their form to suit their needs. Usually, a non-threatening form that would allow them to walk among regular folk without causing concern, and one *Dreaded Form*, in which they grow wings, their fangs grow much larger than usual, and their body's muscles exaggerate.
