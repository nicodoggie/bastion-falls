## Dissolution
After taking the Anasai Castle and capturing the king, revolutionary general [Bartholomew III Strandiz](@/characters/bartholomew-iii-strandiz.md) announced the dissolution of the Kingdom of Anasai. Strandiz had hoped that they would allow his homeland Anasai to reestablish itself as a province, like Sanery and Estrega were, however the revolutionary government decided against it. Anasai's violent opposition the revolution, and its role as the counter-revolutionary bastion have maligned it with the revolutionary army that its dissolution became a symbol for the victory of the Third Revolution.

Instead, its holdings were maintained by the revolutionary government in the interim. The final division of its lands were addressed in the third session of the [First Apgarian Confederate Congress](@/organizations/apgarian-congress.md).
