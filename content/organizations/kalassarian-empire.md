The Kalassarian Empire was a continent-spanning state that succeeded the Republic of the Kalassus in 21 PF. At its peak, it spanned from present-day [Senera](@/locations/senera.md) in the west, most of [Tanduaria](@/locations/tanduaria.md) up to the [Chokhul mountain range](@/locations/chokhul-mountains.md) to to north, the western edges of present-day Sarebia in the east, and portions of northern Ralaka to the south.

Most Beteran states were either once a part of the Kalassarian Empire, or was heavily influenced by them, and many present-day states still claim to be *the* successor to its millenia of history.
