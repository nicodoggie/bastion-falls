The Peacekeepers of Tressemer are an independent, non-governmental agency tasked with the
protection and management of {{ loc(name="Port Tressemer") }}. They were established due to
the limited resources that can be allocated to an armed force, such as a *gendarmerie* in 
{{ loc="Raibon Island" }} due to the [Treaty of Turain](@/misc/treaty-of-turain.md).

# History

In the years following the end of the {{ evt(name="Poasan-Apgarian Conflict") }}, the
{{ evt(name="Treaty of Turain") }} limited the amount of armed forces on 
{{ loc(name="Raibon Island")}} as a whole. While the 
[Gendarmerie](@/organizations/gendarmerie-nationale.md) had an exception in its existence
as a defense force and a law-enforcement group, its resources were greatly limited to
prevent arming them, and using the exception as a loophole to militarize the island.

For this reason, the Governor of {{ loc(name="Sanery") }} who administers Raibon authorized
the use of a bounty system to augment these forces. In this way, they can account for the 
expense differently. While this system was useful for catching high-value criminals, this
system let low-level thugs off the hook, as not being worth the effort due to the relatively
low value of such bounties. 

While the bounty system did initially relieve the gendarmerie of the burden of additional
recruitment and related equipment costs, it was clear that after a few years, it was not a
sustainable measure, as the baseline of lawlessness on Tressemer increased.

## The Mercenary Guild

To address the increasing lawlessness, a group that included some prominent mercenaries from
the {{ org(name="Hunting Lodge")}} petitioned the {{ org(name="Town Council of Tressemer")}}, 
and proposed that bounty hunters must be a member of a guild before being allowed 
to take bounties.

The proposed *Mercenary Guild* would then enforce a tiered bounty system, where each specific 
instance of lawlessness was given a rank and a specific monetary value. In order to take higher 
bounties, members would be required to maintain a quota of lower-tier bounties first. The 
Council accepted the proposal and enacted an ordinance formalzing the Mercenary Guild by 1257.

## Formation

In 1260, {{ cha(name="Anda Antorra")}} was disturbed by the amount of people unjustly caught
by other mercenaries, making false charges to quickly fill the low-tier quota. She used her 
earnings from bounties to hire other mercenaries to catch those who were creating trumped up
charges to enrich themselves. As this kind of fraud was considered a higher-tier bounty, 
she still needed to ensure that they met the minimum quota of lower-tier bounties.
So, she convinced these mercenaries to pool their resources, so they might rotate between these
lower-tier and higher-tier bounties without much disruption to their priority.

As they increased in popularity, Antorra saw other mercenaries want to join their "tier pool".
But at these scales, she believed that she needed to formalize the operation. The called their
group *The Peacekeepers of Tressemer* and created a framework of guidelines that members would
have to follow.

## Expansion

Since the foundation of the Peacekeepers, Antorra kept on reinvesting her own earnings into it.
She purchased equipment from {{ org(name="Kincade Enterprises") }} to ensure that her mercenaries
had what they needed to perform their tasks, established informant networks to make it easier for
them to gain information on their marks, and other such expansion efforts.

Other mercenaries wanted to take advantage of all those advantages, and wanted to join into the
pool, that soon, they pretty much cornered the market on lower-tier jobs that it became a de 
facto requirement for a mercenary to deal with the Peacekeepers to do mercenary work in 
Tressemer.

## Official Deputization

By 1265, the Peacekeepers of Tressemer have grown to such a degree that it already had enough
infrastructure to act as a law-enforcement agency all on its own. Its own bylaws and guidelines
were in line with those of the *gendarmerie* itself, and in some cases even exceeded its
requirements. Through the intercession of then vice mayor {{ cha(name="Gustavia Krana") }},
Anda Antorra was able to petition the Governor to officially dissolve the Mercenary Guild, and 
merge its functions into the Peacekeepers' own. A motion was passed in the 
{{ loc(name="Sanery Provincial Hall") }} that rubberstamped the deputization.

# Present-Day Functions

Today, the Peacekeepers encompass all functions of a law-enforcement agency, including border
patrol, dock inspection and penitentiaries. They act as the local policing force as well, 
removing the need of the gendarmerie to maintain a force in Port Tressemer.

Funding comes through cuts from bounties, and from funding for non-combat related services.
