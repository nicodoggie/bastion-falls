Unspoiled Hydration was formed to address the even-increasing need of potable drinking water on \[location:98|Raibon Island\]. In its original inception, the organization was incorporated to provide the upper class of \[location:126|Port Tressemer with \]an uninterrupted supply of clean drinking water for a premium service rate.

Raibon's primary body of water, famed \[location:167\] was deemed undrinkable, not only due to the inherent water pollution of shipping, and human habitation, but due to the fact that the river itself is brackish. Inflow from the surrounding sea is at a greater rate than the outflows from tributaries like the \[location:305\]. The idea of water desalinization was rediscovered from Kalassarian documents found in ruins on northern Apgar, and its development and construction on Tressemer was funded by the \[organisation:310\].

As of 1275, it serves almost the entirety of Tressemer's wealthy West District, and a number of mid to upscale establishments west of the river. A number of new desalination plants are under development to provide water to the eastern part of Raibon as well, but due to socio-political conditions in that area, securing both land and funding has proven difficult.
