{{ stub() }}

La Camaraderie de la Mer, or simply La Camaraderie, is a privateering organization secretly funded by the Apgarian government, in part to sidestep the restrictions put in place by the [Treaty of Turain](@/events/treaty-of-turain.md) at the end of the [Poasan-Apgarian Conflict](@/events/poasan-apgarian-conflict/_index.md). 

Officially, La Camaraderie is a sailor's guild that operates across [Apgar](@/locations/apgar.md) that certifies the caliber of ship officers and sea-worthiness of shipping vessels. While they do fulfill these functions to their entirety, with a bureaucracy that spans the country, it is an elaborate front for their efforts to circumvent the Seneran Navy patrols given the authority to regulate the Sarmatian leg of the Sarmatian-Posaran sea routes.
