_The Hags of Hama_ are a coven of magically-gifted women who resided in the historical [Town of Hama](@/locations/town-of-hama.md). Founded by the legendary [Hama](@/characters/Hama.md), the group became the defenders of [Raibon Island](@/locations/raibon-island.md) from foreign interlopers, and the rest of the world of [Thera](@/locations/thera.md) from interplanar ones.

The existence of the Hags of Hama stretches back to [Kalassarian](@/organizations/kalassarian-empire.md) times, about two decades before the [Fall of the Western Empire](@/events/fall-of-the-western-kalassarian-empire.md), but some of their rituals and traditions extend to even before the Kalassarians dubbed what is presently Raibon Island *Mauricia*. Those traditions rooted from the Estregan [Hausi](@/ethnicities/hausi.md) sea peoples who had populated the islands, who venerated the *White Witches of Tichom*. Tichom was their name for Raibon, which meant "Largest Piece Beyond the Edge" in the old Estregan dialect they spoke. The name "White Witches" is how the Hags referred to themselves within the group, and the term is also used to refer to them among the locals of [L'Illes Apgarie](@/locations/l-illes-apgarie.md).

# History

Not much is corroborated about the history of the Hags of Hama. For example, until recently, the eponymous Hama, founder of the Hags, was thought to be a mythical character instead of a true historical figure. Historians, especially those of the Divine Masochist tradition doubted the veracity of their purported abilities. The [Orthodox Divine Masochist](@/religions/divine-masochism/orthodox/_index.md) position that magic disappeared from the land after the persecution and death of the Masochist was in contradiction with the assertion that the Hags of Hama were able to perform magical feats well into the 9th century AI. Even some of the more prominent contemporary scholars after the [Fall of Bastion](@/events/fall-of-bastion.md) cast doubt on writings about the powers of the Hags, as they were quite the outlier in the historical record. Current scholarship purports that by the 5th century, most magical societies seem to have lost the ability on a wide scale. It was not until the 6th day of the 8th month of 1275 AI that the it was even confirmed that the Town of Hama existed, when the crew of the [Rozenmaiden](@/organizations/rozenmaiden.md) under the leadership of [Captain Hedwig Rosa Rosenkrantz](@/characters/hedwig-rosenkrantz.md) triggered its return via magical means. 

Research and excavation efforts have only recently begun, and are only currently being executed by members of the Hags themselves, and amateur crew-members of the Rozenmaiden, with only informal invitations to members of the academia pending talks regarding the town's legal status within the Apgarian Government.
