The Monadic Order of the Ram is a mystery cult dedicated to the worship of \[race:116\], a race of humanoid beings born with goat hooves, horns, differently-colored, leathery skin, and an innate ability to cast magic.

Their membership is constrained to a rural area in Central Apgar. Their cult has similar religious elements, philosophies and traditions with those of the \[organisation:79\], but it holds a Cornups as its central divine figure. It is theorized that the ideas of Masochism were introduced shortly after the life of the historical Cornups upon which the cult is based.

As a mystery cult, they do not outwardly reveal their association with the religion. They have secretive echelons of membership that the prospective member must go through to receive the full revelation, because of this, not much is known about them.
