title = "Rescuing Principium"
+++

After a few months of planning a recon mission into the Seneran Royal Navy's Headquarters
in [Port Surrey-on-the-Brahms](@/locations/port-surrey-on-the-brahms.md), news finally arrived
of their fate. La Camaraderie spies caught wind that the captured crew of the derelict ship, 
the *[Principium](@/vehicles/principium.md)*, was to be executed on the 11th Day of the 9th Month 1275.
However, many members of the crew of the [Rozenmaiden](@/organizations/rozenmaiden.md) disappeared 
on the 4th Day of the 9th Month during the [Parade of the Spirits](@/events/parade-of-the-spirits.md).

Depending on when the displaced members of the Rozenmaiden crew return, other members of La Camaraderie
will be forced to do something, since the literal deadline is coming soon.

The broad outline of what I expect to be preparing for on this adventure:
  - The Travel Phase
    - Whether or not La Carnalis and some others are forced to move forward to Senera
      there will be a part of the adventure where the Rozenmaiden will be sailing.
  - The Reconnaissance Phase
    - While La Camaraderie do have operatives on the ground, and have had some of that information
      related to them, the latest information has not arrived yet
  - The Rescue Phase
    - The players are free to do all kinds of shit here, so we will have to complete the map of the area, 
      and define NPCs that act and react to certain things. However, ultimately, the aim of the Senerans
      would be to be so convincing in fighting against any interlopers, that the rescued member would
      be simply accepted into La Camaraderie as a long-term spy on Raibon Island.
