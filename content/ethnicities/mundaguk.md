The Mundaguk people are natives of the mysterious [Moreaux Island](@/locations/moreaux-island.md). Colloquially, they are called
the [_Monsters of Moreaux Island_](@/misc/monsters-of-moreaux-island.md), as popularized by the title of [Andre Arquette's](@/characters/andre-arquette.md) seminal work
of the same name. The [Mundaguk Language](@/languages/mundaguk.md) is poorly-documented due to the hostile nature of the island's inhabitants since
the departure of the shipwrecked survivors that include Arquette.

# Discovery
In 1269 AI, an expedition to document the various ethnic sub-groups in and around the islands of [L'Illes Apgarie](@/locations/l-illes-apgarie.md) was launched, in a 
collaboration between researchers from the [University of Mayonne](@/organizations/university-of-mayonne.md) and the [Estregan Institute](@/organizations/estregan-institute.md).
This was due to reports of a subset of ethnically [Estregan](@/ethnicities/estregan.md) people who have thrived in even the smallest atolls in the island chain, 
and have endured by providing services to pirates, smugglers and privateers hunted by [Seneran Navy](@/organizations/seneran-navy.md) patrols.

A confrontation between a Seneran Frigate and a vessel bearing the [Bouillard](@/organizations/bouillard.md) family crest, had damaged the hull of their ship forcing them to find a
nearby island. The uncharted island was surrounded by a mangrove forest and, to their surprise, was populated by a number of people who spoke a language similar to the 
[Estregan Language](@/languages/estregan.md).

By general consensus by the survivors, they dedicated the island to the voyage's deceased captain, [Marvin Moreaux](@/characters/marvin-moreaux.md) when
they publish their reports on it. The natives called themselves the _Mundaguk_, meaning "Men at the edge \[of the world\]". The Mundaguk practiced a
form of gerontophagic ritual cannibalism.

# Ritual Cannibalism
Contrary to popular belief, the Mundaguk people did not mindlessly prey on other humans. Such a practice would have been a detriment to the survival of their
already small population. Instead, they perform a _ritual sacrifice_ of older individuals in the community. After a certain age, or if one is proven to be mentally-
infirm, a person undergoes a month-long ritual cleansing, by bathing in water boiled with a variety of medicinal herbs and flowers.

Then, once the preparation of the body is complete, the island shamans prepare a certain mushroom, called the Moreaux mushroom in Arquette's book, to dilute its potent
etfects. The brew is given to the sacrifice's family, which would stimulate their senses and hunger. The mushroom has the unusual effect of making human flesh, not just
palatable when consumed, but makes it downright irresistable. The sacrifice's throat is then sliced. Before the person even succumbs to death, their relatives proceed to
consume their flesh.

Often the effect wears off after the meal, as the medicinal bath contains some of the antidote to the mushroom, but if the preparation of either the body. or the brew
was incorrect, there could be a chance of something going horribly wrong.

# Seclusion
Perhaps due to the fact that the survivors of the shipwreck took many of the Mundaguk people's cultural items, as well as stocks of the Moreaux mushroom, they
have shown aggression towards any who may attempt to land upon their shores. However, there were some reports of Moreaux mushroom being sold in the Apgarian black market.
Either a group of people have secretly established an exclusive deal with the people, or they may have been able to cultivate it elsewhere.
