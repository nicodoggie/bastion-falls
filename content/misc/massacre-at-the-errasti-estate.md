Murder! An entire family found dead, hanging from the side of their home, east of [Port Rainoso](@/locations/port-rainoso.md). The Errasti family, whose \[race:181\] patriarch had moved them from far-off [Garatoniè](@/locations/garatonie.md) in south eastern [Apgar](@/locations/apgar.md) 40-odd years past, were well-known for their excellent pheasants and eggs. Now, almost the entire family had been brutally stripped, flayed and displayed hanging by their necks using ropes that dangled from their home's balcony. Almost, with the exception of young [Maitea Errasti](@/characters/maitea-errasti.md), who remains missing. 

The perpetrator or perpetrators, as the case may be, and motive behind the massacre has yet to be discovered. A reward of 500 gold coins is offered by the L'Gendarme Raibonesse for information leading to their arrest.
