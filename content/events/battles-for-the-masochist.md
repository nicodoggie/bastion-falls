The Battles for the Masochist are a series of campaigns, battles and revolts by Apgarian members of the [Church of the Divine Masochist](@/religions/divine-masochism/_index.md), mostly centered in the Kingdoms of [Sanery](@/organizations/kingdom-of-sanery.md) and [Estrega](@/organizations/kingdom-of-estrega.md) territories, for the cause of religious freedom.

Many of the Apgarian Kingdoms of the [Silent Ages](@/concepts/silent-ages.md) were very hostile to followers of Divine Masochism and the [Arzhadadi faith](@/religions/arzhadad.md), particularly, due to their strict adherence to a strict monotheism.

# History

## Conversion of Anasai

The Kingdom of Anasai was always a bulwark of the Masochist faith. It was said that their first king was actually Masochist, and only paid lip service to Apgarian Paganism to appease his subjects. Whether or not those stories were true do not change the fact that during the many Masochist persecutions in Apgarian lands, they often found refuge in Anasai. Officially, Minervan worship was considered the state religion of the kingdom for its entire existence. That is until 1007 AI, when King Henri II Beauchamp officially converted to Masochism, and named Divine Masochism as the state religion. 

The Primate of Poasah [Primate Nimrah IX](@/characters/nimrah-ix.md) named Henri II's brother [Bernard Beauchamp](@/characters/bernard-beauchamp.md) as the Archbishop of the historical Grand Diocese of Hapgaria, reestablished "as reward for Anasaian piety".
