The {{ fam(name="Savoy") }} coup d'etat was a conspiracy that led to an armed attempt to
seize control over the {{ org(name="Bouillard")}} organization. Ultimately, the attempt
failed, but it had wide-ranging implications to many of its individual members.

#  Root Cause
{% spoilers() %}
The House of Savoy of [Rainoso](@/locations/port-rainoso.md), during the leadership of [Lemuel Savoy](@/characters/lemuel-savoy.md) pledged their allegiance to the Bouillard family. Agreed upon by his sisters, and
his children, the entire family have dedicated their lives to be the protectors and helpers of the Bouillards
for many generations. The House is led by the [Pater Familius](@/families/savoy/index.md#pater-familius), who
is typically selected by 
_[agnatic primogeniture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primogeniture#Agnatic_primogeniture)_ where the 
first-born male of the family would gain the title. 

In breaking with tradition, Lemuel's children, [Madison](@/characters/madison.md), 
[Monroe](@/characters/monroe.md) and [Yenna](@/characters/yenna.md) agreed that Monroe, the second child,
would become *Pater Familius* instead of the first-born Madison. This was for two reasons:
  1. Madison did not want the burden of becoming *Pater Familius*.
  2. Monroe married [Nathalie Bouillard](@/characters/nathalie-bouillard.md), 
     [Romulus Bouillard's](@/characters/romulus-bouillard.md) younger sister.
This would make Monroe's line the main line of the family, and would make his eldest male the next to
take the *Pater Familius* title.

Eventually, Madison's children learned of both the traditional primogeniture, and of the agreement to
make Monroe's line the main one. Madison's eldest child, [Nicanor](@/characters/nicanor-savoy.md) did
not really care, as he had no interest in the position as well. [Naim](@/characters/naim-savoy.md)
however, became angry at his father, and was constantly complaining to his wife, his children, and anyone
who would care to listen to him. [Portencia Bentayga](@/characters/portencia-bentayga.md) had similar ambitious boasts, saying that
if Bouillard blood was all it took, then her children would have a claim as well, since she had 
Bouillard ancestry as well. 

The claims of both Naim and Portencia would lay a seed of dissent into some of their children, most notably
on [Percival Savoy](@/characters/percival-savoy.md), their eldest son. After Naim's death, he and his
mother began planning steps to stage a coup d'etat against the main line of Savoys at first, then
against the Bouillards themselves.
