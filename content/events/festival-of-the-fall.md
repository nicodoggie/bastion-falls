Coinciding with the Autumn Harvest Festival, the Fall is often mistaken to be named after the fact that it is celebrated during the fall season. In reality though, the festival gets its name from a significant event in \[organisation:79|Divine Masochist\]scripture called the Fall Into Masochism, ascribed to the verses describing how the Venerable Matron had taken in the Divine Masochist as her servant.

That the festival is celebrated during the Fall Harvest is not coincidental, however. Emperor Tumultus IV of the Kalassar had designated many of the pagan festivals as days of holy observation within the Divine Masochist Church. As The Fall was widely believed to have happened close enough to the Kalassarian harvest festival, they were merged.
