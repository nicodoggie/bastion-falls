# Bastion Falls

The year: 1275 and the world is in the brink of a disaster of a scale that was
not even thought possible.

50 years ago, Bastion, considered the most important city by many states and
religions in the land, had been consumed by an inexplicable dark orb of massive
proportions. Since then, trade networks have been disrupted, religious belief
had been shaken to their foundations, and strange, mythological monstrosities
have begun ravaging the lands.

Since the Fall of Bastion, people have begun exhibiting powers that were once
believed to be utter fantasy--powers attributed to the gods and goddesses of
days before history. Some have begun to use their newly-obtained powers for
their personal gain, believing that they were granted such marvelous feats as
divine affirmation of their rule. And yet some, have used their talent for the
betterment of all.

What had caused the Fall of Bastion? Where do these powers manifest from? Are
these the End of Days, as prophesied millennia ago?
