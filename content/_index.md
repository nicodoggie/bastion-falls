# Bastion Falls

The year: 1275 and the world is in the brink of a disaster of a scale that was
not even thought possible.

50 years ago, Bastion, considered the most important city by many states and
religions in the land, had been consumed by an inexplicable dark orb of massive
proportions. Since then, trade networks have been disrupted, religious belief
had been shaken to their foundations, and strange, mythological monstrosities
have begun ravaging the lands.

Since the Fall of Bastion, people have begun exhibiting powers that were once
believed to be utter fantasy--powers attributed to the gods and goddesses of
days before history. Some have begun to use their newly-obtained powers for
their personal gain, believing that they were granted such marvelous feats as
divine affirmation of their rule. And yet some, have used their talent for the
betterment of all.

What had caused the Fall of Bastion? Where do these powers manifest from? Are
these the End of Days, as prophesied millennia ago?

# How It Came To Be

I was actually developing a different long term campaign that would be radically different, with a number of 
homebrew races, classes and rulesets built upon the D&D 5e system. I had all these notes and ideas, but it I needed more
time to get them ready. My wife wanted to play a game in the meantime.

So I planned to make the most generic, clich√© setting that wasn't set in a published setting, so I can just make shit
up as I went along (my brain won't let me do that in an established setting for some reason). So I invented some regions 
and ethnicities that had some analogues in the real world. Bastion was kind of like Constantinople, and the Fall coincided,
year wise, more or less, with the year that Constantinople fell to the Turks.

Betera was more or less Europe, with a late medieval flavor, and its polities were descendants of a broken empire, the Kalassar,
who were basically Romans. I set it up as a low-magic setting so that I wouldn't have had to explain how society 
evolved with magic. Then all of a sudden, some unexplained cataclysm poured magic out into the world. Then blondies became magic.

I needed a religion, so I went with a lampoon of Christianity called *Divine Masochism*, and then they were fighting against a 
fundamentalist reform subset called the "Reformists". I wanted to even make the differences more nuanced to reflect actual
religious schisms and that none of them are actually an "evil" ideology, just some minor doctrinal differences blown out of proportion
by zealots. But the wife was not too receptive to it, so the zealots took control.

Then the pandemic happened, and the campaign spiralled out into a multi-year, multi-PC game with a LOT of locations. It is now 
super hard to keep track, so I needed a wiki of sorts. This is what this is now. 

Some day, I might get bact to making that setting that I wanted to make before this happened. Some day...
