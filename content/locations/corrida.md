# Corrida

The country of Corrida, so named because it was a corridor between the \[location:315\] mountain range to the north, and the \[location:316\] mountain range to the south.

The landscape is dotted by many basins, waterfalls, cliffsides, and evergreen woodlands. It was a great valley with a number of rivers and tributaries to the Great River \[location:317\] that flowed east to west down until the \[location:318\], through the Kingdom of \[location:42\].

Corrida did not have a formal central government, but was ruled by many smaller polises with a shared cultural identity.
