*Garatoniè*, also called *La Garatoniè Apgarienne* is the partially isolated north-western section of a group of territories called the [Garatonian Lands](@/locations/garatonian-lands.md). The territory was retained as a part [Apgarian Confederacy](@/locations/apgar.md) after the rest of the lands granted to the nomadic [Garatonians](@/ethnicities/garatonian.md) were ceded to [Poasah](@/locations/poasah.md) under the terms of the [Treaty of Turain](@/events/poasan-apgarian-conflict/treaty-of-turain.md) in 1255.
