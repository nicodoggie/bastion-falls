# Ahuria

The Ahurian Empire is a massive theocratic autocracy ruled by a lineage of god-princes, who are both the secular and temporal centers of their government. The country claims possession the entirety of the continent of [Ralaka](@/locations/ralaka.md). and the Gizan Peninsula, as well as a huge portion of the eastern half ot the Ranoan Peninsula.


## Geography

### The Ahurian Mainland

The Ahurian Mainland politically stretches across almost the entirety of the Ralakan continent. The population is distributed across almost every region within the continent, with the exception of its south eastern reaches, which are barred by an impassable desert. 11 of the 14 administrative regions of Ahuria are within the Ahurian Mainland. It is bordered to the north by the [Posaran Sea](@/locations/posaran-sea.md), to the west by the [Sarham Sea](@/location/sarham_sea.md), and to the east by the [Sea of Giza](@/locations/sea_of_giza.md).

[Kolha](@locations/kolha.md), Ahuria's twelfth administrative principality, is isolated from the rest of Ahuria, in the center of the Beteran Landmass. It is bounded to the north and west by the [Central](@location/central_poasan_diocese.md) and [Southern Poasan Dioceses](@location/southern_poasan_diocese.md), respectively. To the north east, it meets the [Gulf of Eternal Dispute](@/locations/gulf_of_eternal_dispute.md). To the south and east, Kolha shares borders with three of its former provinces. [Sur](@/locations/sur.md) and [Kalamba](@/locations/kalamba.md) to the east, and [Ar](@/locations/ar.md) to the south. These states are 3 of the 5 so-called [Secessionist Principalities](@/misc/secessionist-principalities.md) tnat have formed after the death of Kolha XVIII.

### Tarsan Possessions

Burtian politics prior to the Fall of Bastion is yet to be expanded.

Portions of this document referencing the City of Burtz and its
sphere of control as the Eastern Kalassarian Empire, and their
diplomatic situation should be considered incomplete.

Tarsa refers to the continent to the east of Betera, and is connected by the [Isthmus of Bastion](@/location/isthmus_of_bastion.md). On its eastern shore, the Ahurian possessions of [Giza](@/locations/giza.md) and [Manascula](@/locations/manascula.md) can be found.

Once countries in their own right of Giza and Manascula were client nations of the Burtian Empire before they were taken over by the Ahurians. Giza was the first large territorial acquisition taken by Ahuria after the semi-mythical days of the Great Ahuriyata.

Giza, taken first, is bounded to the north by Manascula, to the west by the Posarang Sea, to the south by the Sea of Giza, and to the east by the Ya'naa Desert.

Manascula, taken nearly half a century later, is bounded to the west by Burtz and the Calamutian Strait, the north and east by the Ogadian mountain range, and to the south by Giza.

### Sorha

Sorha, the capital principality of Ahuria and seat of the Ansou Ahuriyata, god-king of all Ahuria, is northwestern-most region of Ahuria. The land is very resource rich, with mountain-ranges filled with gemstones and metal ores; forests filled with a variety of wildlife, and the Tears of the Gods, a gulf which is large and deep enough to be a good naval base of operations.

The Hakamisayato, or the Palace on the Isle of the Gods is an island that houses the capital city of the empire. The entire palace complex was built on the northern foot of the Foot of the Sky, the sole mountain in the middle of the island.

### Kolha

Kolha, one of the first lands conquered by the Ahurian Empire outside of the
Ralakan Continent. The Great Ahoriyata himself, along with his youngest child
had led the invasion force that took most of the South Central Kalassar, which
encompasses that is now known as Southern Poasah, Kolha, Ar, Mir,
Ralamba, Sarha, Sur and the Talamir Island.

After the fall of the Kalassarian Empire, the Kolhan princes have capitalized on
the chaos and had even sacked the City of Poasah itself. However, a coalition
mobilized by the Emperor in Bastion, had driven the Ahurian forces back,
settling close to Kolha's modern border with the Kingdom of Poasah.

After the death of Kolha XVIII, god-prince of Kolha Ahuria, a coalition formed by
his children refused to accept a new prince from the mainland. They were
convinced that one from the mainland could never truly understand the different
socio-political situation in the Kolhan lands, and their proximity to their
erstwhile foes. 

Kolha XVIII's seven children commissioned a grand fleet to form a blockade on the
Mirian shore to prevent the arrival of the newly ordained Kolha XIX. Mainland
Ahurian generals, however, found a solution by sending a fleet of privateer
ships with a mix of Ahurian soldiers deployed from Manascula. and a mercenary
force from Tanduaria and Nura. 

After 20 years of civil war, Kolha XIX was able to keep most of the northern
territory when he brokered a truce. Two of Kolha XVIII's children died during the
wars, but the remaining five portioned of the southern territories for
themselves, and formed individual states: Ar, Kalamba, Mir, Sarha and Sur.

The Mirian Islands were also taken by Ahuria, but due to its distance to Kolha,
administration of the islands was given to the governor of Giza, a position most
recently granted to the 13th ranking Ansa.

## Culture

The Ahurians observe a rigid social structure with defined social roles.
