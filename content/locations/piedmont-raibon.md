A settlement at the foot of Montrabar on the banks of the \[location:305\], which is a tributary to the \[location:167\]. It is one of the many towns and cities in the \[location:10\] named Piedmont, which literally translates to "foot of the mountain". It has become a hub of trade a few years after its founding, after a passage was found that connected \[location:306\] to the source of the Durain River.

The settlement is accessible by small to medium-sized flat-bottomed boats via the Durain River, with most traffic coming from \[location:126\] to facilitate trade from the mountains, and from the eastern side of \[location:98|Raibon Island\]. It is also accessible via a passage that leads to the more established Montrabar Pass, which also served to more efficiently connect it to the Piedmont and a number of farmland.

Some prospectors have recently began settling in the Piedmont in hopes of finding rice veins of ore in and around the Montrabar mountain range, especially due to the slowly dwindling output of the iron mines at \[location:307\].
