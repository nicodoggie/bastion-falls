# Mehicania

The Kingdom of Mehicania is an independent country in the Posaran Basin with a tumultuous history of war and conquest. Most recently in 1207, the country faced a cultural and political revolution helmed by the [Hermanos de la Libertad](@/organizations/hermanos-de-la-libertad.md), literally *The Brotherhood of Liberty*, which sought to overthrow the Mehicanian Royal Family and to join the [Apgarian Confederacy](@/locations/apgar.md).
