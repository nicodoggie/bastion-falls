# Mehicania

Mehicania is a country south of the [Apgarian Confederacy](@/locations/apgar.md) and was a group of states within it. They were once part of the Confederacy, but seceded from it. The Confederacy attempted to reverse the secession via military action, which then prompted the Kingdom of Poasah to defend the fledgling nation. This prompted the [Apgarian-Poasan Conflict](@/misc/apgarian-poasan-conflict.md), which lasted from 1253 to 1255.
