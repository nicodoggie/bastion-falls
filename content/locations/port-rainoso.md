{{ incomplete() }}

Port Rainoso is the largest settlement and capital township of [Raibon Island](@/locations/raibon-island.md). The island itself is administered by the mayor and town council of Rainoso, and is fairly independent from the government of its nominal  [province of Sanery](@/locations/sanery.md), whose administrative center is in mainland Apgar.

Rainoso's importance is tied to the [Heimann Sound](@/locations/heimann-sound.md), the southern mouth of [Samain River](@/locations/samain-river.md), which can accommodate a large volume of shipping to the north. The port town, because of this, houses a number of satellite offices of prominent trading companies from the [Posaran Sea](@/locations/posaran-sea.md) region, notably the [Mirian Trading Company](@/organizations/mirian-trading-company.md), which holds a near-monopoly of the Posaran sea trade.
