# Port Rainoso

Port Rainoso is the largest settlement and capital township of Raibon Island. The island itself is administered by the mayor and town council of Rainoso, and is fairly independent from the government of its nominal province of Sanery, whose administrative center is in mainland Apgar.

Rainoso's importance is tied to the Heimann Sound, the southern mouth of Samain River, which can accommodate a large volume of shipping to the north. The port town, because of this, houses a number of satellite offices of prominent trading companies from the Posaran region, notably the Mirian Trading Company, which holds a near-monopoly of the Posaran sea trade.

The lack of influence by Seneran Naval forces on the island, due to a concession  given by the [Divine Alliance](@/organizations/divine-alliance.md) in the [Treaty of Turain](@/events/treaty-of-turain.md) that officially ended the [Poasan-Apgarian Conflict](@/events/poasan-apgarian-conflict/_index.md) stating that Senera may not occupy any of the islands in the L'illes Apgarie island chain.
