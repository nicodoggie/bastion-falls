Port Rainoso is the largest settlement and capital township of Raibon Island. 
The island itself is administered by the mayor and town council of Rainoso, and is
fairly independent from the government of its nominal province of Sanery, whose
administrative center is in mainland Apgar.

Rainoso's importance is tied to the Heimann Sound, the southern mouth of Samain
River, which can accommodate a large volume of shipping to the north. The port
town, because of this, houses a number of satellite offices of prominent trading
companies from the Posaran region, notably the Mirian Trading Company, which holds
a near-monopoly of the Posaran sea trade.

The lack of influence by Seneran Naval forces on the island, due to a concession 
given by the [Divine Alliance](@/organizations/divine-alliance.md) in the Treaty of Turain that officially
ended the [Poasan-Apgarian Conflict](@/misc/poasan-apgarian-conflict.md) stating that Senera may not occupy any of the
islands in the L'illes Apgarie island chain.
