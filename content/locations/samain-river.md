The main river on [Raibon Island](@/locations/raibon-island.md). It bisects the island almost equally in a north-south direction. It sources its water primarily from groundwater collected in a *[freshwater lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(hydrology))*, the [Dustain River](@/locations/dustain-river.md), as well as snow-melt from the [Montabar Mountain Range](@/locations/montrabar-mountain-range.md).
