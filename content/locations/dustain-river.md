+++

The only major tributary to the [Samain River](@/locations/samain-river.md). It's waters ultimately derive from the glacial snowmelt upon the peaks of the [Montrabar Mountain Range](@/locations/montrabar-mountain-range.md), especially [Trabar's Peak](@/locations/trabars-peak.md), which then collects into aquifers and lakes, most notably the lakes [Soiree](@/locations/lake-soiree.md) and [Runir](@/locations/lake-runir.md). Water flows down primarily through the [Beauchane Falls](@/locations/beauchane-falls.md) into the river's *headwaters*. 

The town of the [Raibonian Piedmont](@/locations/piedmont-raibon.md) was built about 300 yards west of Beauchane Falls, along the Dustain's banks. The settlement of [Poisson](@/locations/poisson.md) was built further downstream, near where the Dustain meets the Samain.
