The *Sarmatian Sea* is a large body of salt water on the western coast of the [Apgarian Confederacy](@/locations/apgar.md), and wholly contains the island kingdom of [Senera](@/locations/senera.md). While ordinarily, the large majority of these waters would be under the jurisdiction of the [Apgarian Navy](@/organizations/apgarian-military.md#navy), due to the war concessions given in the [Treaty of Turain](@/events/treaty-of-turain.md), they are patrolled almost exclusively by the [Seneran Navy](@/organizations/seneran-military.md#navy)
