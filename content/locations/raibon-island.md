# Raibon Island

{{ map(asset="locations/raibon-island.png", width=500) }}

Raibon Island is the largest and most populous island in the L' Illes Apgarie chain. Its government is fairly autonomous its supposed administrative region of Sanery due to the special status enshrined in the Treaty of Turain. The Treaty also specifies that the islands and the surrounding waters of L'Ille Apgarie as a demilitarized zone. A consequence of this, along with Raibon's geographical features made its capital, Port Rainoso, an attractive home to a number of official maritime offices, as well as a number of somewhat "ad hoc" ones.

The strategic importance of the island in north-south maritime trade is the Heimann Sound, which allows easy access of large trade vessels through the Samain River. At the opposite end of the Sound, is the town of Port Tressemer, sometimes considered the second capital of the island.

## History

The island was once named Mauricia by the Kalassarian Empire when it was settled in the 111 AI. Not many records of Kalassarian administration survived due to the Sinking of the Town of Hama in 910 AI. It is unknown why the Kalassarians were not able to settle the area in and around the Sound. Its strategic advantages were numerous, and would have been a logical choice. However, the land was empty when Rainoso was founded by Estregan explorers under the auspices of King Raibon I of Estrega almost 800 years later.

### Hama

The [Town of Hama](@/locations/hama.md) was founded on the site the native Hausi called the Tichom. The existence of the town was considered mythological by scholars for years, as remnants of the settlement were never found, but recently discovered Kalassarian records indicate that the Kalassar were granted those lands for a settlement by the native ruling class. The settlement was used as a trade outpost between Kalassarian Hapgaria and Seneria.

During the Fall of the Western Kalassarian Empire, Mauricia, and therefore Hama was forgotten as shipping lanes were disrupted. The town fell into disrepair, but remained settled, increasingly, by local Hausi elites. By the end of the 5th century, the town had become the cultural and religious center of a cult focused on the worship of a version of the goddess Pomona.

By the 6th century, trade has somewhat resumed between mainland Betera and the Seneran kingdom that had risen from the ashes of the Kalassar. Hama had been rediscovered, and once more grown in prominsnce. Attempts by Seneran traders to settle upon either ends of the Samain River were heavily opposed by the natives, however ensuring that Hama was the only largely developed area on the island. Reasons on why were conflicting--some cited religious importance, others mention fear of certain political repercussions. But the situation remained until mid to late 10th century AI.

It remains a mystery to this day why the town of Hama disappeared, and where exactly it was located, but scholars often cite seismic activity could have been the root cause. Narratives regarding the "sinking" have caused many to speculate that the town may be underneath the waters in or around Hama's Tears. Adventurers' attempts to find any indication are unfruitful. Some believe that the town is underneath what is now the Turbiere de Hubar, but the nature of the bog makes it difficult to even begin.

### Hausi

The Hausi were once the native people of the island. When the island was discovered by Kalassarian explorers, the people were described as "unsophisticated and barbaric, but capable of performing incredible feats of magic".

They seem to have originally believed in a kind of Animism, wherein each living being was either endowed by a goddess of nature, or are themselves avatars of the goddess. By the time the Kalassarians have settled in the island, those beliefs seem to have evolved to incorporate the Kalassarian pantheon. Each creature was said to be an amalgamation of pieces of the souls of gods. The proportion that an individual contains dictates their nature. A tree. for example is mostly made of the soul of Pomona, and a monkey has equal propotions of Pomona and Volupta, and smaller amounts of Minerva and Justicia. In the 5th century, during the primacy of Hama as a political entity on the island, and the appearance of the group called the Hags of Hama, their beliefs have shifted to the worship of these hags as an embodiment of the will of the gods. After the Sinking of the Town of Hama, the Hausi have lamented its loss, and had become a part of their local lexicon as swear words and curses.

In the ensuing years, the Hausi and their descendants have come to ascribe religious and cultural importance to theTurbiere de Hubar. The Hags of Hama themselves were said to have begun to reside in the Bog. Offerings and prayers are directed toward it, in addition to the Hags themselves. Their dead is laid to rest in the waters in and around it. They also place a general reverence upon the site, promulgating a set of legends and stories about the Bog and the Hags of Hama, including the lore surrounding the Frogmen and the Deep Lore.
