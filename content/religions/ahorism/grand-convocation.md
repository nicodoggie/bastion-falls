The Grand Convocation is a meeting of the highest-ranking members of the [Ansa Ahuriyata](@/organizations/ansa-ahuriyata.md) of the [Ahurian Empire](@/locations/ahuria.md), often called during the death of the King Sorha. The meeting takes place in the capital of the empire and seat of the King, [The Island of the Gods](@/locations/island-of-the-gods.md) in the [Sorha Principality](@/locations/sorha.md).

According to Ahurian tradition, the first Grand Convocation was called for by the [Great Ahuriyata](@/religions/ahorism/great-ahuriyata.md) himself, not only to announce that he was to delegate his authority to his twelve eldest sons and daughters, but to designate each and every Ahurian into the [Grand Ordering of the World](@/religions/ahorism/grand-ordering-of-the-world.md), which was the first step in formalizing the [Ahorite](@/religions/ahorism/_index.md) tradition, and the governance of the Ahurian Empire as a whole.
