{{ incomplete() }}

The Ahore is the dominant, and only official state religion of the [Ahurian
Empire](/countries/ahuria.md). The belief is that God himself had returned from
the Great Beyond in order to correct the ills of mankind.

Though opposed to bloodshed, the Great Ahuriyata (literally, god among men), had
waged a righteous war to unite all peoples under his banner, and teach them the
Starlit Path--a collection of Sutras that all must adhere to, in order to escape
the Wheel of Suffering, into the Great Beyond.
## The Ahurian Caste

After the conquest of [Ralaka](/continents/ralaka.md), the Great Ahuriyata was
said to have found that most of humanity has yet to be ready to be free of their
earthly bounds. Their souls are yet tethered tightly to the World Threads, and
must be gradually loosened from it, lest they are ruined before they are ready
to escape into the Great Beyond. He then commissioned a grand census of the
Lands of the People to determine how far along each person is along the Starlit
Path. 

From the records collected by his scribes and priests, he had determined that
there were certain traits preserved along bloodlines, that had effects on every
individual's soul. He made groupings of families and organized them according to
4 different categories.
### Kirsharti

There are two subdivisions within the Kirsharti, or the servant caste. The class
of the recently brought low to be rehabilitated called the Pariya Kirsharti; and
the class of the docile and subservient called the Konti Kirsharti.

#### Pariya Kirsharti

The Great Ahuriyata decreed the creation of the Pariya sub-caste in the [Sutra
of the Servant Bound](#the-sutra-of-the-servant-bound). Pariya are mostly
convicted felons given a life sentence, and their children up to a certain
generation, based on the severity of the crime. Serious offenses that are not
egregious enough to warrant the death sentence, but are terrible enough that
temporary imprisonment cannot be considered a proper penance for the crime. 

Even if they are technically equal in rank with the Konti Kirsharti, Pariya are
often treated as below them. A descendant of a Pariya beyond the mandated
punishment are raised as a Konti Kirsharti of the last Pariya ancestor's master.
