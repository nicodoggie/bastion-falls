The Silent Ages traditionally refer to the years between the [Fall of the Western Kalassarian Empire](@/events/fall-of-the-western-kalassarian-empire.md) and the [Fall of Bastion](@/events/fall-of-bastion.md). Recent scholarship argue, however, that the age should be defined by the earliest evidence of the disappearance of magic from Thera, and tail-ended by its return, which does coincide with the Fall of Bastion.
