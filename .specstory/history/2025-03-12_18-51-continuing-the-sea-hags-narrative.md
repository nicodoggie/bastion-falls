# Continuing the Sea Hags Narrative (2025-03-13 02:51:14)

_**User**_

We have transcribed parts of this list of notes into the following narratives @sea-hags-the-story-so-far-part-1.md and @sea-hags-the-story-so-far-part-2.md . The latter is not complete yet, and it seems like we've stopped at @part-2.txt, specifically at line 535. Can we continue from where we left off until 545?

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you continue the narrative in sea-hags-the-story-so-far-part-2.md, picking up from where it left off at line 535 in your notes and continuing through line 545.

I'll edit the file to add the next section of the narrative based on your notes:

I've continued the narrative in sea-hags-the-story-so-far-part-2.md, picking up where it left off and incorporating the details from your notes between lines 535-545. The addition covers:

- Sister Sierre and Hedwig going to buy supplies on the platform
- Hedwig's issue with dresses after hers was ruined
- Cra√ßoix's rudeness
- The mention of nun's habits
- The public bath located two blocks from the "Shrieking Shack"
- Hedwig's bet involving Dom, Sister Sierre, and Cotto
- Hedwig's promotion from deckhand to mess staff
- The announcement about departing to Rainoso
- Everyone getting their share and bonus from the loot
- The expected 5-day trip to Rainoso

The narrative flows naturally from where it left off and maintains the same style and tone as the previous sections. Would you like me to continue with more of the notes, or would you like to review this section first?
