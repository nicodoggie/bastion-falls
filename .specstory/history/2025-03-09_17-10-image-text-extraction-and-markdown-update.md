_**User**_

@ahore-01-18.jpg can we attempt to extract text from this image, use context from the attached previous interaction, and code from the @Codebase  and append the text into @01.md 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I've appended the extracted text from the image to the end of the `01.md` file. If you need any more adjustments or have further questions, feel free to ask!

_**User**_

Poasan nobility, not Posaran. though there is a Posaran sea, and Kolha is adjacent to it, it isn't what is being referred to in the first paragraph of this text

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I've corrected "Posaran" to "Poasan" in the first paragraph of the appended text. Let me know if there's anything else you need!

_**User**_

it seems that there are quotation marks that are missing from the transcription. was this because they were not detected. or removed intentionally? if the latter. please place them back.
