## Polishing Obsidian: Ancient Techniques and Materials (2/7/2025, 5:32:15 PM)

_**User**_

considering the rock composition and general hydrogeology of the areas in Senera, what materials would neolithic, to bronze age cultures use to polish, say, obsidian to be useful as a mirror?

---

_**Assistant**_

Given the geological composition of the Western and Northern Maltreks, here are the likely materials and methods for polishing obsidian into mirrors:

### 1. **Limestone-Based Polishing Materials**
   - **Chalk**: Fine, soft powder from limestone, ideal for final polishing stages.
   - **Limestone Grit**: Coarser grains for initial smoothing, available in various grades.
   - **Calcite Crystals**: Found in caves, could be crushed into fine powder for polishing.

### 2. **Volcanic and Basalt-Based Materials**
   - **Basalt Dust**: Harder abrasive for rough shaping, sourced from basalt layers.
   - **Volcanic Ash**: Fine particles from volcanic activity, useful for intermediate polishing.

### 3. **Water and Sediment-Based Materials**
   - **River Sand**: Quartz grains from riverbeds, sorted by water for different grit sizes.
   - **Clay**: Mixed with water to create a paste for smoothing surfaces.

### 4. **Organic Materials**
   - **Leather**: Used with abrasives for final polishing, providing a smooth finish.
   - **Plant Fibers**: Combined with abrasives for hand polishing.

### 5. **Polishing Techniques**
   - **Wet Grinding**: Using water with limestone or basalt dust to reduce friction and heat.
   - **Dry Polishing**: Final stages with finer materials like chalk or calcite powder.
   - **Lapping**: Rubbing obsidian against flat stones with abrasives to achieve a mirror finish.

### 6. **Cultural Context**
   - **Knowledge Transmission**: Techniques passed down through generations, with specific materials sourced from local areas.
   - **Trade**: Obsidian mirrors could become valuable trade items, with polishing techniques influencing their value.

### Suggested Etymological Development:
If you’re deriving a word for polishing/smoothing, it could be based on the primary material used, such as chalk or limestone. For example:
- **Chalk-Based**: A term derived from the word for chalk (e.g., "kalk" → "kalken" for "to polish").
- **Limestone-Based**: A term derived from limestone (e.g., "lim" → "limen" for "to smooth").

This approach aligns with how "sanding" in English is derived from "sand."

so abrasive basalt rock for flattening, then wet grinding, finally lapping in that order would be accomplished?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, that sequence would be both practical and historically plausible for polishing obsidian into mirrors. Here's how it would work in detail:

### 1. **Abrasive Basalt Rock for Flattening**
   - **Purpose**: Initial shaping and flattening of the obsidian surface.
   - **Material**: Coarse basalt grit or flat basalt stones.
   - **Method**: 
     - Rub the obsidian against a flat basalt surface with coarse grit.
     - Use water to reduce friction and prevent overheating.
   - **Result**: Removes major irregularities and creates a roughly flat surface.

### 2. **Wet Grinding**
   - **Purpose**: Smoothing the surface and removing scratches from the initial flattening.
   - **Material**: Finer basalt dust or limestone grit mixed with water.
   - **Method**:
     - Apply the abrasive slurry to a flat stone or leather pad.
     - Rub the obsidian in circular or back-and-forth motions.
     - Continuously add water to maintain a smooth grinding action.
   - **Result**: Achieves a smoother surface, preparing it for final polishing.

### 3. **Lapping**
   - **Purpose**: Achieving a mirror finish by removing micro-scratches.
   - **Material**: Very fine abrasives like chalk powder, calcite, or finely ground limestone.
   - **Method**:
     - Use a soft material like leather or felt as a polishing pad.
     - Apply the fine abrasive with water and rub the obsidian in gentle, circular motions.
     - Continue until the surface becomes reflective.
   - **Result**: A polished, mirror-like finish on the obsidian.

### Sequence Summary:
1. **Flattening**: Coarse basalt grit to remove major irregularities.
2. **Wet Grinding**: Finer basalt or limestone grit to smooth the surface.
3. **Lapping**: Very fine chalk or calcite powder to achieve a mirror finish.

### Cultural and Practical Considerations:
- **Skill Development**: This process would require significant skill and experience, likely passed down through generations.
- **Material Availability**: Basalt and limestone are abundant in the Maltreks, making this process feasible for local cultures.
- **Time Investment**: Polishing obsidian to a mirror finish would be time-consuming, increasing the value of finished mirrors.

This sequence aligns with known historical techniques for polishing stone and obsidian, and it would be well-suited to the geological resources of the Maltreks.

gasam "grinding" < gar "rock" + SUBE -asam perhaps? 

then specialized terms for
flattening: asamgasam < asamitar "rest" + gasam "grinding"
wet grinding: aigasam < ai "water" + gasam
lapping:  kasgasam < kasger "mirror" + gasam

---

_**Assistant**_

Here’s a proposed set of terms for the grinding process, based on the structure and etymology of Early Hick:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/lexicon.md
// ... existing code ...

gasam [ga.sam]
  : grinding
  : gar "rock" + SUBE -asam "under" → gasam
  : ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
  : Note: Literally "under rock," referring to the action of grinding. Forms the base for specialized grinding terms.

asamgasam [a.sam.ga.sam]
  : flattening (initial grinding)
  : asamitar "rest" + gasam "grinding" → asamgasam
  : ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
  : Note: Literally "rest grinding," referring to the initial flattening process. See: [Tool Terms](#tool-terms)

aigasam [ai.ga.sam]
  : wet grinding
  : ai "water" + gasam "grinding" → aigasam
  : ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
  : Note: Literally "water grinding," referring to the use of water in the smoothing process. See: [Tool Terms](#tool-terms)

kasgasam [kas.ga.sam]
  : lapping (final polishing)
  : kasger "mirror" + gasam "grinding" → kasgasam
  : ([compound fusion](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#compound-formation))
  : Note: Literally "mirror grinding," referring to the final polishing stage to achieve a reflective surface. See: [Tool Terms](#tool-terms)

// ... existing code ...
```

### Explanation of Terms:
1. **gasam**: Derived from *gar* "rock" and the subessive case *-asam* "under," referring to the action of grinding. This forms the base for specialized terms.
2. **asamgasam**: Combines *asamitar* "rest" (from *asam* "resting place") with *gasam* "grinding," referring to the initial flattening process.
3. **aigasam**: Combines *ai* "water" with *gasam* "grinding," referring to the wet grinding stage.
4. **kasgasam**: Combines *kasger* "mirror" with *gasam* "grinding," referring to the final lapping stage to achieve a reflective surface.

These terms follow Early Hick’s compound formation rules and semantic patterns, particularly the use of case markers and metaphorical extensions.
