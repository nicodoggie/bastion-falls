_**Assistant**_

Let me check through the provided files for any mentions of members of the Thirteen.

After reviewing both files, I found a relevant mention in `01-refugees.md`. Here's what I found:

```text:01-refugees.md
// ... existing code ...
Asha Keth, one of the Thirteen, was known to have visited Poasah during this time. Her 
presence is recorded in several documents from around 1120 AI, though the exact nature 
of her visit remains unclear. Some speculate she was investigating rumors of 
necromantic activity, while others suggest she was merely passing through.
// ... existing code ...
```

This appears to be the only direct mention of a member of the Thirteen in these files. 
Asha Keth is specifically named as visiting Poasah around 1120 AI (about 155 years 
ago from the current year).

If you'd like to find more references to the Thirteen across your entire codebase, you 
might want to try using agent mode, which can search through all your documents more 
comprehensively.
