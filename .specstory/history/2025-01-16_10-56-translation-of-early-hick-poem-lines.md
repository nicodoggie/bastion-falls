_**Assistant**_

I'll help translate the Early Hick poem from "The Giant of Inespell". Let me analyze it line by line:

```plaintext
1. branrum 'atelbran ma'ales bran'er
   "In ancient times, the first lineage walked the path"

2. branrum 'ilis'er gransed ma'al'es
   "In ancient times, they watched the great seed"

3. branrum 'ilis'er tirai ma'al'es
   "In ancient times, they watched the white air"

4. branrum 'atelbran gras'er makores
   "In ancient times, the first lineage grazed in abundance"

5. branrum 'atelbran gras'er norathes
   "In ancient times, the first lineage rode forth"

6. branrum 'atelbran sinthir'er tomures
   "In ancient times, the first lineage followed the great owl"

7. branrum graslas ma'al'isul torbael
   "In ancient times, they herded toward the mountain father"

8. mabarak'erlas 'isel thranales
   "Walking together with these sacred ones"

9. grasgralul ranekes weslas
   "Through grassy earth to the western stream"

10. branrum gralislas ma'altales
    "In ancient times, they walked the earth together"

11. 'eldegralen asadimrisitar
    "From the bridge of the feywild"

12. branrum 'eldalulbreses norath'er
    "In ancient times, the elven people rode"

13. branrum 'eldalokes bar'erlas talel
    "In ancient times, the elven folk walked to that place"

14. branrum ma'altales sibris'er ma'al'isel
    "In ancient times, those people spoke with these ones"

15. 'ilisimris'er tamines 'isel
    "They taught the truth to these ones"

16. 'ilisimris'er tales 'isul litharel
    "They taught these ones about the moon"

17. 'ilisimris'er kabrastsim gares 'isel
    "They taught these ones to become skilled with hands"

18. 'ilisimris'er tales kaward'er 'isul aiel
    "They taught these ones to guide the waters"

19. 'ilisimris'er kathrakelsim wenes 'isel
    "They taught these ones to make sacred things"

20. 'aterimris 'ilisimris'er talel kakulsim 'isel
    "After that they taught these ones to become wise"

21. ma'al'isel 'ilisimris'er 'isul gralul thides
    "These ones taught those ones about the deep earth"

22. las katorthil altanes, 'al'ises mo'altanesp
    "Despite the great heights ahead, we did not fear"

23. kakethbran ma'altales branum
    "The kin-like people in the past"

24. imris kabranlases 'irur'er, kataksim 'ir'er
    "Because they came from the lineage, they acted skillfully"

25. imris branlases 'ir'er, branlases 'irur'er
    "Because they acted from lineage, from lineage they came"

26. branum altalel hisimris'er kathid matallas tel
    "In the past, those people saw wisdom in many places"

27. maimwesok 'alises magralnat
    "We are the children of the earth-mother"

28. las 'ateltel ma'altalel 'ilislas'er, magralumes hisum'er
    "Despite the time, those people still teach, the earth-mother watches"
```

This appears to be an origin myth or historical epic about the first contact between elves and humans, focusing on the transmission of knowledge and skills from the elves to humans. The repeated use of `branrum` (far past) emphasizes the ancient nature of these events.

_**User**_

if you look at the documentation branrum is specifically a past tense marker used for distant past. the use of it is indeed a stylistic choice, but also has a syntactical purpose

---

_**Assistant**_

I apologize for my oversimplification. You're absolutely right. Let me correct my understanding:

`branrum` is a grammatical marker specifically denoting distant past tense in Early Hick, not just a poetic device. Its repeated use serves both a grammatical and stylistic purpose - it properly marks these events as occurring in the distant past while also creating a rhythmic structure to the verse.

Let me revise some key translations to better reflect this grammatical function:

```plaintext
branrum 'atelbran ma'ales bran'er
[DIST.PAST] first-lineage walk-PST path-ACC
"(In the) distant past, the first lineage walked the path"

branrum gralislas ma'altales
[DIST.PAST] walk-COLL earth-LOC
"(In the) distant past, (they) walked together on the earth"
```

The consistent use of `branrum` at the start of lines indicates these events occurred in a specific temporal frame - the distant past - rather than just being "ancient times" as I incorrectly suggested. This is particularly important as Early Hick has a complex tense marking system, and the choice of `branrum` places these events in a specific temporal context relative to both the speaker and other historical events.

Would you like me to revise more of the translations to better reflect this grammatical structure?

'atelbran is a relativizer. see the ealy hick documentation

---

_**Assistant**_



Ah yes, I apologize. Looking at the documentation, 'atelbran is derived from 'atel (temporal relativizer "when") + bran. Let me correct those first few lines:

````plaintext
branrum 'atelbran ma'ales bran'er
DIST.PAST when PL.person-ABS path-VERB
"When, in the distant past, the people walked the path"

branrum 'ilis'er gransed ma'al'es
DIST.PAST watch-VERB great.seed PL.person-ABS  
"In the distant past, the people watched the great seed"

branrum 'ilis'er tirai ma'al'es
DIST.PAST watch-VERB white.air PL.person-ABS
"In the distant past, the people watched the white air"

branrum 'atelbran gras'er makores
DIST.PAST when graze-VERB PL.cow-ABS
"When, in the distant past, the cattle grazed"
````

The use of 'atelbran introduces temporal relative clauses, which I completely misinterpreted in my first translation. This changes the structure significantly - rather than being simple statements, these lines establish temporal relationships between events in the distant past.

Would you like me to continue revising the translation with this corrected understanding of the relativizer?

gransed means something different @lexicon.md 

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes, looking at the lexicon, I see that `gransed` is a compound word:

```plaintext
grased [ˈgra.sed] "grain" < gras-sed "grass-seed" → grased
```

So let me revise my translation of those first few lines:

````plaintext
branrum 'atelbran ma'ales bran'er
DIST.PAST when PL.person-ABS path-VERB
"When, in the distant past, the people walked the path"

branrum 'ilis'er grased ma'al'es  
DIST.PAST watch-VERB grain PL.person-ABS
"In the distant past, the people watched the grain"

branrum 'ilis'er tirai ma'al'es
DIST.PAST watch-VERB white.air PL.person-ABS
"In the distant past, the people watched the white air"
````

The word `grased` is specifically "grain" (grass-seed), which makes more sense in the agricultural/pastoral context of the poem. Would you like me to continue revising the translation with this understanding?

---

_**User**_

please continue @_index.md @lexicon.md take note of these documents as you do so

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the lexicon and grammar documentation, I need to revise my understanding. Let me break down those lines:

````plaintext
branrum 'atelbran ma'ales bran'er
DIST.PAST when PL.person-ABS path-VERB
"When, in the distant past, the people walked the path"
````

Here we have:
- `branrum` - distant past marker (used in religious/epic contexts)
- `'atelbran` - temporal relativizer "when" (from 'aka-tel "what-time")
- `ma'ales` - plural people (ma- prefix + 'al "person" + -es absolutive)
- `bran'er` - "to walk/path" (from bran "path" + -'er verbalizer)

The structure shows this is a temporal relative clause, which is common in Early Hick epic/religious contexts. The use of `branrum` suggests this is from a formal or sacred text.

Would you like me to continue analyzing the other lines with this improved understanding of Early Hick grammar?

_**User**_

continue

---

_**Assistant**_



Yes, let's continue with the next lines, using the lexicon and grammar:

````plaintext
branrum 'ilis'er gransed ma'al'es
DIST.PAST watch-VERB grain PL.person-ABS
"In the distant past, the people watched the grain"
````
Here:
- `'ilis'er` - "to watch" (from 'ilis "knowledge" + -'er verbalizer)
- `gransed` - "grain" (from gras "grass" + sed "seed")
- `ma'al'es` - plural people in absolutive case

````plaintext
branrum 'ilis'er tirai ma'al'es
DIST.PAST watch-VERB white.air PL.person-ABS
"In the distant past, the people watched the white air"
````
Here:
- `tirai` - "white air" (likely a compound of tir "white" + ai "air/breath")

````plaintext
branrum 'atelbran gras'er makores
DIST.PAST when graze-VERB PL.cow-ABS
"When, in the distant past, the cattle grazed"
````
Here:
- `gras'er` - "to graze" (from gras "grass" + -'er verbalizer)
- `makores` - plural cattle in absolutive case (ma- plural + kor "cow" + -es ABS)

The pattern shows a formal narrative structure with repeated `branrum` marking distant past events, alternating between simple statements and temporal relative clauses with `'atelbran`. Would you like me to continue with more lines?

---

_**User**_

yes. can you continue without showing your analysis at first?

---

_**Assistant**_



Yes, I'll provide the translations first and can explain my analysis if you'd like:

````plaintext
branrum 'atelbran gras'er norathes
DIST.PAST when graze-VERB ride-ABS
"When, in the distant past, they rode forth"

branrum 'atelbran sinthir'er tomures
DIST.PAST when follow-VERB great.owl-ABS
"When, in the distant past, they followed the great owl"

branrum graslas ma'al'isul torbael
DIST.PAST graze-COLL PL.person-PROX-ALL mountain.father-ALL
"In the distant past, they herded together toward the mountain father"

mabarak'erlas 'isel thranales
march-COLL PROX-ERG sacred-ALL
"Together they marched to the sacred place"

grasgralul ranekes weslas
grass.earth-ALL flow-ABS west-ALL
"To the grassy earth by the western stream"
````

Would you like me to explain my analysis of any of these lines?

---

_**User**_

I see htat I made an error here in using norath instead of what I intended (rok). can we start from the top?

---

_**Assistant**_



Ah, I see. Let's restart from the beginning with `rok` instead of `norath`:

````plaintext
branrum 'atelbran ma'ales bran'er
DIST.PAST when PL.person-ABS path-VERB
"When, in the distant past, the people walked the path"

branrum 'ilis'er gransed ma'al'es
DIST.PAST watch-VERB grain PL.person-ABS
"In the distant past, the people watched the grain"

branrum 'ilis'er tirai ma'al'es
DIST.PAST watch-VERB white.air PL.person-ABS
"In the distant past, the people watched the white air"

branrum 'atelbran gras'er makores
DIST.PAST when graze-VERB PL.cow-ABS
"When, in the distant past, the cattle grazed"

branrum 'atelbran gras'er rok'es
DIST.PAST when graze-VERB herd-ABS
"When, in the distant past, the herd grazed"
````

Would you like me to continue with the rest of the lines with this correction?
