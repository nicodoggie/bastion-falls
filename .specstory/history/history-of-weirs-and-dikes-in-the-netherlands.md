_**Assistant**_

The construction of weirs and dikes in the Netherlands began well before the medieval period. The earliest evidence of water management systems dates back to the _Iron Age_ (around 500 PF, or 500 BC in real-world reckoning). These early structures were relatively simple and localized, primarily used to manage water flow in small areas.

By the _Roman period_ (around 0 AI, or 1 AD), more organized efforts were made to control water, including the construction of small dikes and drainage systems. However, it was during the _early medieval period_ (around 500-1000 AI) that larger-scale dike-building projects became more common, as populations grew and the need for land reclamation increased.

So, while the foundations of water management began in the pre-medieval era, the medieval period saw significant advancements in the construction of weirs and dikes, laying the groundwork for the sophisticated systems that would develop in later centuries.
