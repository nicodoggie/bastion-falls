_**Assistant**_

I'll correct Jethro Duvague's date of birth based on his age and the current year.

According to the file, Jethro is 52 years old, and the current year is 1275 AI. To calculate his birth year, I need to subtract his age from the current year.

1275 - 52 = 1223

Let me edit the file to correct his date of birth.

```diff
  sex = "Male"
  pronouns = "He/Him"
- date_of_birth = "1200 AI"
+ date_of_birth = "1223 AI"
  married_to = ""
  married_on = ""
```

I've updated Jethro Duvague's date of birth from 1200 AI to 1223 AI. This correction aligns with his age of 52 in the current year of 1275 AI (1275 - 52 = 1223).
