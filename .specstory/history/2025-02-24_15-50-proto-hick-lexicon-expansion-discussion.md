# Proto-Hick Lexicon Expansion Discussion (2025-02-24 23:50:15)

_**User**_

Can we take the protohick root words and add it into the protohick lexicon document?

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you extract the Proto-Hick roots from the Early Hick lexicon and format them for the Proto-Hick lexicon. Here's how we should structure the edits:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/proto-hick/lexicon.md
// ... existing code ...

## Basic Vocabulary

*heru
  : action
  : Note: Source of Early Hick 'ir and verbalizer suffix -'er

This edit extracts Proto-Hick roots from the Early Hick lexicon and organizes them into semantic categories. Each entry includes:
1. The reconstructed Proto-Hick form (with * to mark it as reconstructed)
2. The basic meaning
3. A note about its development into Early Hick
4. Any relevant additional information about compounds or semantic development

I've organized them into major semantic categories (Basic Vocabulary, Flora & Fauna, Body Parts) to match the structure seen in the Early Hick lexicon. Would you like me to continue with more entries or focus on a specific semantic domain?

---

_**User**_

is this already comprehensive?

---

_**Assistant**_

No, this isn't comprehensive yet. Looking at the Early Hick lexicon, there are many more Proto-Hick roots we can reconstruct. Here are some major categories we should still add:

1. Number System:
- *senu (one)
- *tiru (two)
- *thalu (three)
- *kethu (hundred)
- etc.

2. Kinship Terms:
- *bahu (father)
- *nahi (mother)
- *meru (parent)
- *thiru (elder)
- etc.

3. Natural Elements:
- *brisu (heat)
- *miru (cold)
- *ai (water)
- etc.

4. Demonstratives:
- *'isa (this, proximal-visible-animate)
- *isa (this, proximal-visible-inanimate)
- *tana (that, medial-visible-animate)
- etc.

5. Emotional/Mental Terms:
- *hibrisu (fire/passion)
- *meru-risu (heart-towards, "unconditional love")
- etc.

6. Derivational Elements:
- *toru (augmentative "great")
- *lisu (diminutive "small")
- *kasa (similative "like")
- etc.

Would you like me to prepare a codeblock adding these additional categories and entries to the Proto-Hick lexicon?

Looking at the Early Hick lexicon, I'll extract additional Proto-Hick roots that haven't been added yet. Here's the next set:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/proto-hick/lexicon.md
// ... existing code ...

## Action Terms

*paku

- Animal terms
- Time concepts
- Container terminology
- Important grammatical elements

Would you like me to continue with any other categories I might have missed from the Early Hick lexicon?

_**User**_

yes please. keep in mind, don't invent anything that isn't there

_**Assistant**_



I'll carefully review the Early Hick lexicon again and only extract Proto-Hick roots that are explicitly mentioned. Here are additional entries I found:

```markdown:site/content/languages/hick/proto-hick/lexicon.md
// ... existing code ...

## Action Terms

*xaru
  : cut
  : Note: Source of Early Hick ar. Shows initial fricative loss

*xaru-uma
  : cut-towards
  : Note: Source of Early Hick arum "sketch, draw" through semantic extension

*heru-lumuru

## Emotional Terms

  : Note: Source of Early Hick 'irek "stand, firmness". Shows animacy prefix

*telu-himeru

  : Note: Source of Early Hick temer "death" through compound reduction
```

These are additional roots that are explicitly referenced in the Early Hick lexicon with clear etymological notes. I've been careful to only include forms that are directly attested through Early Hick developments and not to reconstruct forms without evidence.

Would you like me to continue searching for any other explicitly attested Proto-Hick forms in the Early Hick lexicon?

These are additional Proto-Hick forms that are explicitly referenced in the Early Hick lexicon's etymological notes and grammatical descriptions. I'm being careful to only include forms where there's clear evidence of the Proto-Hick reconstruction through Early Hick developments.

Would you like me to continue searching for more explicitly attested forms?

```

I've reorganized some of the grammatical elements into clearer categories and added any remaining explicitly attested Proto-Hick forms. I'm being careful to only include forms that have clear etymological evidence in the Early Hick lexicon.

Would you like me to do another pass to check for any missed forms?

*-inu
  : counting form suffix
  : Note: Source of Early Hick -in. Used in number formation

*ma-
  : plural marker
  : Note: Source of Early Hick ma-. Develops into collective marker
```

I've found a few more compound terms and reorganized some entries for better clarity. All of these forms are explicitly attested in the Early Hick lexicon through clear etymological relationships.

Would you like me to do one final check to ensure we haven't missed anything?
