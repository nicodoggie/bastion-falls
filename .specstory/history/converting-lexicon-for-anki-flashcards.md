can you help convert the lexicon into a format that can be used wifh anki, the flash card app?

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you convert the lexicon into a format suitable for Anki. The most common format for Anki is a CSV (comma-separated values) file with fields separated by semicolons (;).

Here's a suggested structure for the cards:

1. Front (Early Hick word)
2. IPA (if available)
3. Definition
4. Etymology/Notes
5. Tags

Here's how we can start converting it:

```csv
Word;IPA;Definition;Etymology/Notes;Tags
aitar;[ai.tar];rain;Compound fusion: ai-tar "water-fall" → aitar;Precipitation
bramis;[bra.mis];sea mist, coastal fog;Compound fusion: bram-mis "tide-mist" → bramis;Precipitation
miraitar;[mi.rai.tar];cold rain;Compound fusion: mir-aitar "cold-rain" → miraitar;Precipitation
ken;[ken];snow;From PH *kenu. Basic term for snow, showing typical development from PH with final vowel loss. Common in mountain-related terminology.;Precipitation,Weather,Landscape
ris;[ris];reed;Proto-Hick *risu → ris (final vowel loss);Flora,Basic Plant Terms
wud;[wud];wood, tree;Proto-Hick *wudu → wud (final vowel loss);Flora,Basic Plant Terms
gras;[gras];grass;Proto-Hick *grasu → gras (final vowel loss);Flora,Basic Plant Terms
sed;[sed];seed;Proto-Hick *sedu → sed (final vowel loss);Flora,Basic Plant Terms
```

Would you like me to continue converting more entries? I can also suggest some 
alternative formats if you have specific needs for your Anki study method. For 
example, we could:

1. Split definitions into separate cards
2. Create reverse cards (definition → word)
3. Include example sentences
4. Group by semantic categories
5. Add difficulty levels

Let me know what would be most helpful for your study goals!
