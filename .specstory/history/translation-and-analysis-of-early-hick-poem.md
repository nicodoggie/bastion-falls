<think>
Okay, let's tackle this translation and analysis of the poem in Early Hick. First, I need to look at the provided code snippets to understand the language's structure and vocabulary.

The poem is titled "Ibrigral a Eldegral" which translates to "Farmland and Elven-land". From the lexicon, 'ibrigral' is "farmlands" (from 'ibri-gral' meaning "manure-land") and 'eldegral' is likely a compound with 'elde' (from Eldrim borrowings like 'elda' meaning elf) and 'gral' (earth), so "Elven-land".

Looking at the verses:

1. **'ibrigral a eldegral / ka'ales a ka'eldal**  
   - 'a' is "and". 'ka-' is a prefix meaning "like, similar to". 'ales' is "person", 'eldal' is "elf" (from 'elda' + agentive '-l'). So: "Farmland and Elven-land / Like people and like elves"

2. **thirthral branthral thurthral mirthral**  
   These are the seasons: summer, spring, autumn, winter. So listing all seasons.

3. **'alrumul 'ales thralarm'er / eldalul 'ales thralarm'er**  
   - 'alrumul' is "that person's" (distal possessive). 'thralarm'er' combines 'thral' (sacred/day) + 'arm' (volitional) + 'er' (verbalizer). So: "That person's person sacredly acts / The elf's person sacredly acts"

4. **kagral a kakel a kameris**  
   - Adjectives: 'kagral' (earthy), 'kakel' (blue), 'kameris' (beloved). So: "Earthy and blue and beloved"

5. **ka'ales a ka'eldal thralarm'er**  
   Repeats the "like people and like elves sacredly act"

6. **gral a kel a ter a mal**  
   Nouns: 'gral' (earth), 'kel' (leaf), 'ter' (flow), 'mal' (pool). So: "Earth and leaf and flow and pool"

7. **'ales thralarm'er thranal**  
   "Person sacredly acts the seasons"

8. **eldal thralarm'er th

'a is actually a disjunctive coordinator (like english or), ru is the additive (like english and)

Ah, thank you for the correction! That changes the interpretation significantly. Let me try again with the translation, now understanding that 'a means "or" and ru means "and":

```markdown
Title: "'ir'erlas 'ibrigralel eldegrales" 
(The farmers' or the elven-peoples' [something])

Let me attempt a rough translation verse by verse:

1. "kaimtir wes'erimris po'asaul asamgrales"
   (Something about earth/land and people)

2. "kathir togar seneraul terules"
   (A line about flow or movement)

3. "ewes ma'alisul malisbeles tag'er branum"
   (Something about people/beings and their actions)

4. "'ilsul o 'imsal o ruel mes'er branum"
   (A series of connected elements with 'o' conjunctions)

5. "rantirduoktanes! 'imwen o wenkulok o rutanes!"
   (An exclamation with more 'o' conjunctions)

6. "'ir'erlas 'ibrigralel eldegrales"
   (Repeats the title theme)

7. "marasud o brastak o eweses tag'er 'a matengwaes tag'er"
   (More connected elements with both 'o' and 'a' coordinators)

8-10. The final verses seem to build to a conclusion with "meris'el 
      brismeres! sinasnat es!"

Without more context about the vocabulary, I can see this is a complex poem 
with a structured pattern using various coordinators ('a', 'o', ru) and 
what appears to be a mix of descriptive and active elements. The glottal 
stops (marked with ') seem to play an important role in the phonology.

Would you be willing to provide more information about specific vocabulary 
elements? That would help me give a more accurate translation.

Also, I notice some interesting structural elements:
- The use of '-el' and '-es' suffixes seems consistent
- There's a pattern of using 'o' as an internal coordinator
- The exclamation marks suggest emotional high points
- The repetition of the title theme mid-poem is likely significant

Let me analyze this Early Hick poem and provide a translation. I'll break it down line by line:

```text
Title: "'ir'erlas 'ibrigralel eldegrales"
Lit: "The farmers' or the elven-peoples' movement-inward"
Free: "The Migration of Farmers or Elves"

1. kaimtir wes'erimris po'asaul asamgrales
   ka-'im-tir wes'er-imris po'as-aul asam-gral-es
   "From the dark second-watching, onto the sacred ground"

2. kathir togar seneraul terules
   ka-thir to-gar sener-aul ter-ul-es
   "Like air, the great-bones of our ancestors' flow"

3. ewes ma'alisul malisbeles tag'er branum
   ewes ma-'alis-ul malis-bel-es tag'er branum
   "Together with many-people's pool-mouths made in the past"

4. 'ilsul o 'imsal o ruel mes'er branum
   'il-sul o 'im-sal o ru-el mes'er branum
   "Good and evil and together-ERG heart-acted in the past"

5. rantirduoktanes! 'imwen o wenkulok o rutanes!
   ran-tir-duok-tan-es! 'imwen o wenkulok o ru-tan-es!
   "Some second guides! That witch and sorceress together!"

6. 'ir'erlas 'ibrigralel eldegrales

   "Some-thing-like horn-strikes"

9. kator'imer ma'aliese 'irur'er
   ka-tor-'imer ma-'alis-es-e 'irur'er
   "Like great-nurturing to many-people repeatedly"

10. ma'al'isul sibrises kamathrakel imur'er
    ma-'al-'is-ul sibris-es ka-mathrakel imur'er
    "Many-people's spirits like-radiant evil-act"

11. meris'el brismeres! sinasnat es!
    meris-'el bris-mer-es! sin-asnat es!
    "The beloved heats the bird! First descent!"
```

This appears to be a poem about migration or movement, possibly describing a 
historical or mythological event involving both farmers and elves. It uses 
complex Early Hick literary devices including:

1. The "o...ru" coordination pattern typical of formal/literary style
2. Heavy use of compounds and derivational morphology
3. Ritual/sacred terminology
4. Multiple exclamative constructions
5. Complex spatial case marking

The theme seems to center around conflict or tension between farmers and 
elves, with references to witches/sorceresses, blood, and evil acts, but 
also mentions nurturing and togetherness. The repeated title line serves as 
a refrain.

Would you like me to analyze any particular aspect in more detail?

what I was going for with kaimtir imwes'er, is like a rot invasion
poasah's plains, which are infested with rot

I changed it to
atales imwes'er imtirel po'asaul asamgralel

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, that makes much more sense! Let me revise my translation for that line:

````text
atales imwes'er imtirel po'asaul asamgralel
a-tal-es imwes'er im-tir-el po'as-aul asam-gral-el
place-ABS invade-VERB evil-second-ERG po'as-POSS rest-earth-ERG

"The places are invaded by the evil second (ones) onto Po'asah's resting grounds"
````

This paints a much clearer picture - it's describing an invasion of Po'asah's 
plains by corrupted/evil forces. The use of `imwes'er` (to invade/encroach) 
combined with the `im-` prefix on `tir` (second) suggests these are 
corrupted or rotting entities. The `asamgral` (resting earth/ground) with 
Po'asah's possessive marker indicates these are his sacred lands being 
invaded.

This first line sets up the conflict much more effectively than my previous 
interpretation. Would you like me to revise my analysis of how this theme 
carries through the rest of the poem?

The invasion/corruption theme would tie in well with later lines like:
- The blood and dawn-strike imagery
- The "evil acts" reference
- The contrast between nurturing and corruption

imtir = rot, not evil second
asamgral = plains, not resting grounds

---

_**Assistant**_



Ah, thank you for those corrections! Let me revise that translation:

````text
atales imwes'er imtirel po'asaul asamgralel
a-tal-es imwes'er imtir-el po'as-aul asam-gral-el
place-ABS invade-VERB rot-ERG po'as-POSS plain-ERG

"The places are invaded by rot upon Po'asah's plains"
````

This is much clearer and more direct - it's describing rot invading or 
encroaching upon the plains that belong to Po'asah. The use of `imwes'er` 
(to invade/encroach) really emphasizes the aggressive nature of the rot's 
spread.

This makes the opening much stronger - it establishes the threat (rot) and 
the location (Po'asah's plains) very clearly. Would you like me to revise 
my interpretation of the rest of the poem with this corrected understanding 
of:
- `imtir` as "rot" rather than "evil second"
- `asamgral` as "plains" rather than "resting grounds"

This would likely change how some of the later imagery connects back to 
this opening theme of rot invasion.

_**User**_

atales here is a relativizer that marks place like "where"

---

_**Assistant**_



Ah! Yes, that changes the syntax significantly. Now I understand:

````text
atales imwes'er imtirel po'asaul asamgralel
atal-es imwes'er imtir-el po'as-aul asam-gral-el
where-ABS invade-VERB rot-ERG po'as-POSS plain-ERG

"Where rot invades Po'asah's plains"
````

This makes much more sense grammatically - `atal` is functioning as a 
relative pronoun for location (like "where"), similar to how Early Hick 
uses other interrogative forms as relativizers. The absolutive marking on 
`atales` shows it's the location being affected by the rot's invasion.

So this opening line sets up a description of places that are being invaded 
by rot across Po'asah's plains. This would flow naturally into the next 
lines describing what's happening in these affected areas.

Would you like me to continue analyzing the poem with this better 
understanding of the syntax? The use of `atales` as a relativizer likely 
affects how we should interpret the structure of subsequent lines as well.

_**User**_

let's continue

---

_**Assistant**_



Yes, let's analyze the next lines with this better understanding:

````text
1. atales imwes'er imtirel po'asaul asamgralel
   "Where rot invades Po'asah's plains"

2. kathir togar seneraul terules
   ka-thir togar senera-ul ter-ul-es
   like-air great-bone ancestor-POSS flow-POSS-ABS
   "Like air through the great bones of our ancestors' flows"

3. ewes ma'alisul malisbeles tag'er branum
   ewes ma-'alis-ul malis-bel-es tag'er branum
   together many-person-POSS pool-mouth-ABS make-VERB past
   "Together the many-peoples' pool-mouths were made in the past"
````

The second line seems to be describing how the rot moves - like air through 
ancestral bones, suggesting an ethereal or pervasive quality to its spread. 
The use of `kathir` (like air) creates a powerful image of the rot's 
movement.

The third line shifts to describing what the people had built together in 
the past - `malisbel` (pool-mouth) might refer to wells or water sources, 
suggesting this was once a settled/developed area before the rot came.

Would you like me to continue with the next lines? Also, please correct me 
if I've misinterpreted any of these compounds or their relationships.

updated the text. imtir is rot, asamgral means plains

---

_**Assistant**_



Ah yes, let me analyze the updated text with those specific meanings in mind:

````text
1. atales kaimtir asamgralel imwes'er po'asaul asamgralel
   atal-es ka-imtir asamgral-el imwes'er po'as-aul asamgral-el
   where-ABS rot-like plain-ERG invade-VERB po'as-POSS plain-ERG
   "Where rot-like plains invade Po'asah's plains"

2. atales kathir togarel seneraul terulel
   atal-es ka-thir togar-el senera-ul ter-ul-el
   where-ABS air-like great-ERG ancestor-POSS flow-POSS-ERG
   "Where the great air-like ancestral flows"

3. ewes ma'alisul kamakres lisbeles tag'er branum
   ewes ma-'alis-ul ka-makres lis-bel-es tag'er branum
   together many-person-POSS like-many see-mouth-ABS make-VERB past
   "Together the many-peoples' many seeing-mouths were made in the past"
````

This paints a clearer picture - it's describing how rot-infected plains are 
spreading into Po'asah's territory. The repeated use of `atales` as a 
relativizer helps build the scene, describing different aspects of these 
locations.

The imagery suggests a corruption spreading across the landscape, with an 
ethereal quality ("air-like"), and references to what was there before - 
structures or features created by many peoples in the past.

Would you like me to continue with the next lines? And please correct any 
misinterpretations of the compounds or grammar.

also while ka- used to be a similarity marker, it's now an adjective marker

---

_**Assistant**_





Ah, thank you! That changes the interpretation significantly. Let me revise with `ka-` as an adjective marker:

````text
1. atales kaimtir asamgralel imwes'er po'asaul asamgralel
   atal-es ka-imtir asamgral-el imwes'er po'as-aul asamgral-el
   where-ABS ADJ-rot plain-ERG invade-VERB po'as-POSS plain-ERG
   "Where rotted plains invade Po'asah's plains"

2. atales kathir togarel seneraul terulel
   atal-es ka-thir togar-el senera-ul ter-ul-el
   where-ABS ADJ-air great-ERG ancestor-POSS flow-POSS-ERG
   "Where the airy great ancestral flows"

3. ewes ma'alisul kamakres lisbeles tag'er branum
   ewes ma-'alis-ul ka-makres lis-bel-es tag'er branum
   together many-person-POSS ADJ-many see-mouth-ABS make-VERB past
   "Together the many-peoples' numerous seeing-mouths were made in the past"
````


This makes more sense - instead of similes, we have proper adjectives:
- `kaimtir` = "rotted" rather than "rot-like"
- `kathir` = "airy" rather than "air-like"
- `kamakres` = "numerous" rather than "many-like"

The poem is describing rotted plains spreading into Po'asah's territory, 
with references to airy flows and ancient structures. Would you like me to 
continue with the next lines?

kathir is white

---

_**Assistant**_





Ah, thank you! Let me revise again with `kathir` meaning "white":

````text
1. atales kaimtir asamgralel imwes'er po'asaul asamgralel
   atal-es ka-imtir asamgral-el imwes'er po'as-aul asamgral-el
   where-ABS ADJ-rot plain-ERG invade-VERB po'as-POSS plain-ERG
   "Where rotted plains invade Po'asah's plains"

2. atales kathir togarel seneraul terulel
   atal-es ka-thir togar-el senera-ul ter-ul-el
   where-ABS white great-ERG ancestor-POSS flow-POSS-ERG
   "Where the white great ancestral flows"

3. ewes ma'alisul kamakres lisbeles tag'er branum
   ewes ma-'alis-ul ka-makres lis-bel-es tag'er branum
   together many-person-POSS ADJ-many see-mouth-ABS make-VERB past
   "Together the many-peoples' numerous seeing-mouths were made in the past"
````


This creates a stronger visual contrast - rotted plains against white flows 
or streams. The color imagery adds to the sense of corruption versus 
purity, or perhaps suggests the seasonal timing (white possibly indicating 
snow or frost?).

Would you like me to continue with the next lines? And please correct any 
other misinterpretations I might have made.
