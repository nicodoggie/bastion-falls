## Serendipitous Word Coining in Worldbuilding (2/7/2025, 3:00:37 PM)

I just realized a serendipitous moment in coining words for the early hick lexicon, and I just have to share it with someone!

a while back, I made a bit of historical worldbuilding about the Malthren of the Magarisok, who had powers of divination that they'd exercise using the Vortex Cove in modern day @the-narrows.md 

eventually, I needed a word for dream, which I called mulis from proto hick muruhilisu night-eye

now I needed a word for vortex, not remembering any of that as bramulis! it's perfect!

That's a fantastic linguistic serendipity! Let me break down why this works so beautifully:

1. `bramulis` [bra.mu.lis] "vortex, whirlpool" 
   - From `bram-ul-lis` "tide-POSS-eye" → "tide's eye"
   - Shows coda simplification where final -l of bramul merges with initial l- of lis

2. `mulis` [mu.lis] "dream, vision"
   - From Proto-Hick *muruhilisu → mulis
   - Shows compound reduction and final vowel loss

The semantic connection between "tide's eye" and "dream/vision" creates a perfect 
metaphorical bridge for the Malthren's divinatory practices! The vortices in the 
cove would literally be "tide's eyes" through which they could see visions.

This kind of accidental coherence often produces some of the most naturalistic 
linguistic developments. It reminds me of how many real-world cultures have 
metaphorical connections between water features and mystical sight/knowledge:

- Ancient Greek `ὀμφαλός` (omphalos) connecting sacred springs and prophetic power
- Norse `Mímisbrunnr` (Mímir's well) as a source of wisdom
- Celtic holy wells associated with visions and prophecy

Your Early Hick compounds `bramulis` and `mulis` capture this same kind of 
cultural-linguistic connection between water, sight, and prophecy. The fact that 
you arrived at this connection organically makes it feel even more authentic!
