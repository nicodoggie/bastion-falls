Here are 10 uncommon Latin-derived first names with their general meanings:

1. Aurelius (golden, from _aurum_)
2. Claudia (lame/enclosing, from _claudus_)
3. Lucretia (wealth/profit, from _lucrum_)
4. Septimus (seventh born, from _septem_)
5. Flavian (yellow/golden-haired, from _flavus_)
6. Octavia (eighth born, from _octo_)
7. Marcellus (young warrior, diminutive of _Marcus_)
8. Livia (bluish/envious, from _lividus_)
9. Cornelius (horn, from _cornu_)
10. Valeria (to be strong, from _valere_)

These names were used in Roman times and some continue to be used today, though 
less frequently. Would you like me to explain the historical context or usage of 
any of these names?
