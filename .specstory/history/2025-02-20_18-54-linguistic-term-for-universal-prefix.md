## Linguistic Term for Universal Prefix (2/20/2025, 6:54:34 PM)

_**User**_

I want to add a prefix for marking all of a certain group.

something like everyone or everything

masin-NOUN

what is a linguistic term for such a prefix

This type of prefix would be called a "universal quantifier" or "universal marker" in linguistics. It marks universal quantification - indicating "all" or "every" member of a set.

Let me help add this to the document. I'll add it under the Number Marking section:

````markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
// ... existing code ...

### Number Marking

Early Hick has five strategies for marking number:

1. Plural Prefix ma-

   - Indicates general plurality
   - ma-mater "boats"

2. Universal Prefix masin- (< Proto-Hick *masinu "complete")

   - Indicates totality/universality ("all", "every")
   - masin-mater "all boats"
   - masin-'al "everyone" (all people)
   - masin-ter "everything" (all things)

3. Partitive Prefix ran- (< *haranu "divide")

   - Indicates "some of" or "part of"
   - ran-mater "some boats"
   - Can develop limiter meaning in context

````

This addition:
1. Introduces the universal quantifier prefix masin-
2. Shows its Proto-Hick etymology
3. Provides clear examples of usage
4. Places it logically within the number marking system

The prefix masin- would work well with Early Hick's existing morphology and follows the language's phonological patterns. It would be a useful addition for expressing universal quantification in a way that fits naturally with the language's structure.

Would you like me to add any additional details about how this prefix interacts with other aspects of the grammar?

how is it marked using leipzig glossing ruls?

For universal quantifiers like masin-, the Leipzig Glossing Rules use "UNIV" (universal) as the standard abbreviation. Here's how we can add glossed examples:

````markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
// ... existing code ...

2. Universal Prefix masin- (< Proto-Hick *masinu "complete")

   - Indicates totality/universality ("all", "every") 
   - Examples with glossing:

   ```gloss
   masin-mater-es
   UNIV-boat-ABS
   "all boats"

   masin-'al-el
   UNIV-person-ERG
   "everyone (as agent)"

   masin-ter-es
   UNIV-thing-ABS
   "everything"
   ```

// ... existing code continues ...
````

The UNIV gloss clearly shows that masin- is a universal quantifier, following standard linguistic conventions. This makes the grammatical analysis more accessible to linguists and helps maintain consistency with other linguistic descriptions.

Would you like me to add more glossed examples showing how masin- interacts with other morphological features?
