# Exploring Words for Speed Extensions (2025-02-17 22:22:25)

do we have a word with a sense that can be extended to mean quick or fast?

_**Assistant**_

Let me analyze the lexicon for potential semantic extensions for "quick/fast". Here are some possibilities based on the entries shown:

1. From motion/water terms:

- `ter` ("flow") could be extended to mean "quick/flowing/fast" since flowing water has connotations of speed
- `ran` ("stream") could similarly extend to "quick" since streams are associated with rapid movement

2. From animal terms:

- `dak` ("snake", from "slither") could potentially extend to "quick" since snakes are known for swift movement

3. From time terms:

- `bran` ("dawn") could metaphorically extend to "quick" since dawn is a rapid transition

Based on semantic typology and the patterns shown in Early Hick, I would recommend extending `ter` to mean "quick/fast". This follows common cross-linguistic patterns where water-motion terms extend to general speed concepts. The word already shows productive compounding and appears in various semantic domains.

To formalize this extension, you could add an entry like:

```markdown
ter [ter]
  : flow; quick, fast
  : Proto-Hick *teru â†’ ter
  : ([final vowel loss](@/languages/hickic/early-hick/_index.md#early-hick-prehistory-to-300-pf))
  : Note: Shows semantic extension from water flow to general quickness. Forms 
    compounds for various speed-related concepts.
  : See: [Motion Terms](#motion-terms), [Water Features](#water-features)
```

This would allow formations like:

- `ter'er` "to move quickly"
- `kater` "quick-like, swift"
- `terok` "swift one, runner"
