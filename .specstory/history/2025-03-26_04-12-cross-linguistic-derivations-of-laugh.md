Based on the search results and cross-linguistic patterns, here are some interesting derivations for words meaning "laugh" across languages:

1. **Onomatopoeic Origins**
- Many languages derive their words for laughter from sound symbolism
- Similar to how Early Hick has `'u'u` for crying from the sound of sobbing
- Examples: 
  - Latin "cachinnare" (from sound of laughing)
  - Japanese "笑う" (warau) possibly from sound symbolism
  - Greek "γελάω" (gelaō) may have onomatopoeic origins

2. **Body Part Extensions**
- Some languages derive laugh words from facial expressions or body movements
- Often related to:
  - Mouth movements (showing teeth)
  - Face muscles (smiling)
  - Chest/belly movement
- Examples:
  - Sanskrit "has-" possibly related to mouth opening
  - Proto-Germanic *hlahjaną possibly connected to throat/chest movement

3. **Emotional/Mental State**
- Some languages connect laughter to:
  - Joy/happiness
  - Pleasure
  - Lightness of spirit
- Examples:
  - Chinese 笑 (xiào) connected to concepts of joy
  - Arabic ضَحِكَ (ḍaḥika) related to brightness/joy

4. **Sound + Movement Compounds**
- Some languages combine aspects of:
  - The sound made
  - The physical action
  - The emotional state
- Examples:
  - Some Austronesian languages combine terms for joy with sound elements

5. **Metaphorical Extensions**
- Many languages extend laugh terms to mean:
  - Mock/deride (negative)
  - Celebrate/rejoice (positive)
  - Express contentment (neutral)

This pattern of derivation often shows cultural attitudes toward laughter, whether 
it's seen as primarily physical, emotional, or social in nature. The etymology 
often reflects whether a culture emphasizes the sound, the facial expression, the 
emotional state, or the social function of laughter.

_**User**_

what proto-hick @lexicon.jsonld words do we have that could go through semantic expansion into laugh?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me analyze the Proto-Hick lexicon for potential words that could semantically extend to "laugh" based on common cross-linguistic patterns.

From the Proto-Hick lexicon, here are some promising candidates for semantic extension to "laugh":

1. `baha` [ba.ha] "rhythmic head motion"
- Already shows connection to repetitive motion
- Could extend to the physical aspect of laughter (head/body movement)
- Similar to how some languages derive laugh terms from body movements
- Current Early Hick descendant is `ba` meaning "nod, agree"

2. `takutaku` [ta.ku.ta.ku] "rhythm" 
- Already shows reduplication pattern common in sound-symbolic words
- Could extend to rhythmic sound of laughter
- Has onomatopoeic origin like many laugh words cross-linguistically

3. `maxi` [ma.xi] "mouth"
- Body part directly involved in laughing
- Many languages derive laugh terms from mouth/facial expressions
- Early Hick descendant is `ma`

4. `hihalu` [hi.ha.lu] "good, kind"
- Shows emotional positivity
- Could extend to joyful expression
- Early Hick descendant is `'il`

Potential semantic development paths:

1. Physical motion path:
```
baha "rhythmic head motion" → "rhythmic body movement" → "laugh"
```

2. Sound symbolism path:
```
takutaku "rhythm" → "rhythmic vocal sound" → "laugh"
```

3. Body part path:
```
maxi "mouth" + reduplicated form → "mouth movement" → "laugh"
```

4. Emotional path:
```
hihalu "good" → "express joy" → "laugh"
```

Would you like me to develop any of these potential etymological paths further?

---

_**User**_

I was actually thinking that it could be a compound that means joyous sound... hmmm `ilsul is something that probably arised in pre or early hick tho... 

hihalu does sound like laughter tho. we could have hiha as a cognate that, since it may be onamotopoeic, is more resistant to sound change?

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes! That's a brilliant observation about `hihalu` having an onomatopoeic quality. And you're right that onomatopoeic words often resist regular sound changes because speakers continue to associate them with the sound they represent.

Let's develop this:

1. Proto-Hick `hihalu` [hi.ha.lu] could have had a cognate form `hiha` [hi.ha] that was specifically onomatopoeic for laughter. This fits well because:
   - The reduplicated `hi-ha` sequence mimics the sound of laughter
   - Many languages have "ha ha" or "hi hi" as laugh sounds
   - The form is similar to but distinct from `hihalu` "good, kind"

2. Sound change resistance:
   - While `hihalu` → Early Hick `'il` through regular sound changes
   - The onomatopoeic `hiha` could resist these changes
   - Maybe becomes Early Hick `'iha` [ʔi.ha] with just the initial h- → ʔ change
   - Preserves the iconic "ha" sound associated with laughter

3. This could create a nice etymological family:
   - Proto-Hick `hihalu` → Early Hick `'il` "good"
   - Proto-Hick `hiha` → Early Hick `'iha` "laugh"
   - Early Hick `'ilsul` "joy" (from `'il` + `sul`)

This shows a semantic split where:
- The full adjective `hihalu` follows regular sound changes and maintains the "good" meaning
- The shortened onomatopoeic form `hiha` resists some changes and specializes for "laugh"

What do you think about this development? It gives us both the expected sound changes and a plausible explanation for preserving the iconic laugh sound.

---

_**User**_

we do have a derivation for hihalu though, hi- the animacy marker and halu that means good. could be that halu is the word that meant laugther, then sometime during protohick expanded into the concept of good, and has an irregular sound change that turned it into hahu

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes! That's a really interesting direction - working backwards from the known morphology of `hi-halu`. This kind of semantic development (laugh → good) is quite naturalistic too. Let's map this out:

Pre-Proto-Hick:
- `halu` meaning "laugh/laughter"
- Undergoes semantic expansion to mean "good" (laugh → joy → good)
- Has an irregular variant `hahu` specifically for "laugh"
  - The `l` → `h` change could be from assimilation to the existing `h`
  - This kind of irregular change in frequently used words is common
  - The `hu` ending stays consistent

Proto-Hick:
- `halu` primarily means "good" now
- Gets the animacy prefix: `hi-halu` "good" (with animacy marking)
- `hahu` preserves the original "laugh" meaning
- The two forms are still recognized as related

This gives us a really nice etymology showing:
1. Original concrete meaning (laugh) → abstract meaning (good)
2. Irregular phonological variant preserving original meaning
3. Regular form taking on new grammatical marking (animacy prefix)

This development feels more grounded in the established morphology than our previous idea, since we know `hi-` is definitely the animacy marker. Would you like to develop the Early Hick outcomes for both forms?

---

_**User**_

now when would halu likely become hahu? @early-hick.lsc 

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the sound changes in `early-hick.lsc`, the `l` → `h` change would most likely happen during the Proto-Maritime Hick stage (Stage 1), specifically around these rules:

```
h-liquid-cleanup cleanup:
  h [liquid] => h * / _
  [liquid] h => * h / _

liquid-cluster-cleanup cleanup:
  [liquid] l => l * / _
```

However, we don't see a direct rule for `l` → `h`. This suggests that `halu` → `hahu` would be an irregular sound change that happened before these systematic changes.

Given the presence of `h-liquid-cleanup` rules, it makes sense that this irregular change happened during early Proto-Hick, when there was already some instability in sequences involving `h` and liquids. The irregular change could be motivated by:

1. Frequency of use (common words often develop irregular forms)
2. Sound symbolism (maintaining the breathy/laughing quality with `h`)
3. Dissimilation from the regular form that became "good"

So the timeline would be:

1. Pre-Proto-Hick: `halu` "laugh"
2. Early Proto-Hick: 
   - Regular form `halu` expands to mean "good"
   - Irregular variant `hahu` develops specifically for "laugh"
3. Late Proto-Hick:
   - `hi-halu` forms with animacy prefix for "good"
   - `hahu` remains as "laugh"

This puts the irregular change before the systematic sound changes in the `.lsc` file, which makes sense since irregular changes often precede and escape regular sound changes.

Would you like to work out how both forms would develop through the rest of the sound changes into Early Hick?

---

_**User**_

let's first just document hahu in @lexicon.md . I suppose we could document the etymologies in the appropriate files in @hickic 

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes! Let's add `hahu` to the lexicon. It would go in the H section. Here's the entry format following the style of other entries:

```markdown
hahu [ha.hu]
  : laugh, laughter
  : Proto-Hick *hahu < Pre-Proto-Hick *halu
  : Note: Shows irregular l → h change preserving original "laugh" meaning while 
    regular form *halu developed into "good". Forms verb hahu'er "to laugh"
  : See: ['il](#il) "good", ['ilsul](#ilsul) "joy"
```

This entry:
1. Gives the pronunciation
2. Shows the primary meaning
3. Shows the etymology with the irregular sound change
4. Notes the semantic split from the regular form
5. Shows the verbal derivation
6. Cross-references related terms

Then we can document the full etymology in the Proto-Hick files, showing:
1. The Pre-Proto-Hick form and meaning
2. The irregular sound change
3. The semantic development of the regular form
4. The preservation of the original meaning in the irregular form

Would you like me to draft those etymological entries as well?

_**User**_

let's put it in the correct lexicon file @h.jsonld 

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes! Let's add the `hahu` entry to `h.jsonld`. It should go in the `@graph` array, following the same structure as other entries. Here's the entry:

```json

```

This entry:
1. Follows the OntoLex-Lemon format
2. Shows both the synchronic and diachronic information
3. Links to related terms
4. Includes the verbal derivation
5. Specifies semantic fields
6. Notes the irregular development that preserved the original meaning

Would you like me to also draft the Proto-Hick entry that would show the earlier stages of development?

---

_**User**_

yes please

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll draft the Proto-Hick entry that would go in the Proto-Hick lexicon. This would document both `*halu` and `*hahu`:

```json
{
  "@id": "phk:halu",
  "@type": [
    "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
    "lexinfo:Adjective"

      "@id": "phk:hahu",
      "relationshipType": "has variant",
      "note": "irregular form preserving original meaning"
    }
  ]
},
{
  "@id": "phk:hahu",
  "@type": [
    "ontolex:LexicalEntry",
    "lexinfo:Noun"
  ],
  "canonicalForm": {
    "@type": "ontolex:Form",

  },
  "etymology": {

    "etymon:note": "Irregular variant preserving original 'laugh' meaning while regular form developed into 'good'"
  },
  "sense": [
    {
      "@type": "ontolex:LexicalSense",
      "definition": {
        "@value": "laugh, laughter",
        "@language": "en"
      },

      "relationshipType": "variant of",
      "note": "regular form that developed into 'good'"
    }
  ]
}
```

This documents:
1. The original Pre-Proto-Hick form and meaning
2. The split into regular and irregular forms
3. The semantic development of the regular form
4. The preservation of meaning in the irregular form
5. The relationship between the two forms

Would you like me to also draft the Pre-Proto-Hick entry to document the earliest attested stage?

_**User**_

so hahu is laugh pretty stably since protohick yes? then we would document the @etymology.jsonld into @phk-etymology.jsonld right?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes exactly! We should add an entry to `phk-etymology.jsonld` to document how `hahu` remained stable from Proto-Hick to Early Hick, unlike many other words that underwent significant changes. Here's the entry to add to the `@graph` array in `phk-etymology.jsonld`:

```json
{
  "@id": "ehketym:hahu",
  "@type": "baety:Etymology",
  "baety:derivedForm": {
    "@id": "ehk:hahu"
  },
  "baety:sourceForm": {
    "@id": "phk:hahu"
  },
  "baety:soundChangeApplied": [
    "Preservation of form: hahu → hahu"
  ],
  "baety:hasPeriod": "c. 500-600 AI",
  "baety:hasEtymologicalNote": "One of few words to resist regular sound changes, preserving both form and meaning 'laugh' from Proto-Hick. Shows unusual stability possibly due to sound symbolic/onomatopoeic nature and contrast with regular development of *halu 'good'.",
  "baety:hasConfidenceLevel": "Certain"
}
```

This entry:
1. Shows the unusual stability of the word
2. Notes that it resisted regular sound changes
3. Explains why (sound symbolism and contrast with `halu`)
4. Dates it to the main period of Proto-Hick to Early Hick changes
5. Marks it as a certain etymology

Would you like me to also draft the Pre-Proto-Hick to Proto-Hick etymology entry to document the earlier irregular `l` → `h` change?

---

_**User**_

nah, since it's still in proto-hick, it's enough that we know. in-world linguists have not connected the hickic languages to other beteran language familiies yet

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah right! Good point. Since we're working within the in-world linguistic knowledge, they haven't traced Proto-Hick back to earlier language families yet. They just know:

1. Proto-Hick `hahu` "laugh" exists and is stable
2. Proto-Hick `halu` → `hi-halu` → Early Hick `'il` "good" shows regular development
3. The relationship between these forms might be suspected by some scholars, but it's not established in-world yet

So we'll stick with documenting what we know for certain in the Early Hick period - that `hahu` is one of those rare stable words that resisted the usual sound changes, possibly due to its sound symbolic nature.

The entry we just wrote for `phk-etymology.jsonld` is sufficient to document this understanding from the in-world perspective. Would you like to add any other entries or cross-references to related terms?

---

_**User**_

in these etymology.jsonld documents, it makes sense that the majorSoundChanges are a property of an EtymologyCollection, but shouldn'l irregular sound changes be associated with specific Etymology objects in the @graph? would they be part of the basty:soundChangeApplied property? though we should have a definition of that property in the @etymology.jsonld ontology, shouldn't we?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, absolutely! We need to better structure how we handle sound changes in the ontology. Let's add to `etymology.jsonld`:

1. First, define the property for sound changes:
```json
{
  "@id": "soundChangeApplied",
  "@type": "owl:ObjectProperty",
  "rdfs:domain": "Etymology",
  "rdfs:range": "baphon:SoundChange",
  "rdfs:label": "Sound Change Applied",
  "rdfs:comment": "Links an etymology to specific sound changes that affected the word"
}
```

2. Then we need properties to distinguish regular vs irregular changes:
```json
{
  "@id": "hasSoundChangeType",
  "@type": "owl:ObjectProperty",
  "rdfs:domain": "baphon:SoundChange",
  "rdfs:range": "SoundChangeType",
  "rdfs:label": "Has Sound Change Type",
  "rdfs:comment": "Specifies whether a sound change is regular, irregular, or analogical"
},
{
  "@id": "SoundChangeType",
  "@type": "owl:Class",
  "rdfs:label": "Sound Change Type",
  "rdfs:comment": "Classification of sound changes by their scope and regularity"
}
```

Then in the actual etymology documents, an irregular change would be documented like:
```json
{
  "@id": "ehketym:hahu",
  "@type": "baety:Etymology",
  "baety:derivedForm": {
    "@id": "ehk:hahu"
  },
  "baety:sourceForm": {
    "@id": "phk:hahu"
  },
  "baety:soundChangeApplied": {
    "@type": "baphon:SoundChange",
    "baety:hasSoundChangeType": "IrregularSoundChange",
    "baety:description": "Resistance to regular vowel loss and h-dropping",
    "baety:motivation": "Sound symbolic/onomatopoeic preservation"
  }
}
```

This way:
1. Regular sound changes are documented at the collection level
2. Irregular changes are documented per etymology
3. We can specify the type and motivation for each change
4. The ontology properly defines all these relationships

Does this structure make more sense for handling the different types of sound changes?

---

_**User**_

in this case, could the `soundChangeApplied` property be an array? do RDF ontologies have special conventions for using plural forms in its terms?

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, good question about RDF conventions! Yes, RDF properties can have multiple values, and there are some common conventions for naming:

1. Properties that can have multiple values are typically named in the singular form, not plural, even when they accept multiple values. This is because RDF naturally allows multiple triples with the same subject and predicate.

2. Common RDF naming patterns:
- `hasX` for singular relationships
- `soundChangeApplied` (not `soundChangesApplied`)
- `involves` (not `involve`)
- `includes` (not `include`)

So in our case, we should keep `soundChangeApplied` singular in the ontology:
```json
{
  "@id": "soundChangeApplied",
  "@type": "owl:ObjectProperty",
  "rdfs:domain": "Etymology",
  "rdfs:range": "baphon:SoundChange",
  "rdfs:label": "Sound Change Applied",
  "rdfs:comment": "Links an etymology to a sound change that affected the word"
}
```

And in the actual data, we can have multiple values as an array:
```json
{
  "@id": "ehketym:hahu",
  "@type": "baety:Etymology",
  "baety:soundChangeApplied": [
    {
      "@type": "baphon:SoundChange",
      "baety:hasSoundChangeType": "IrregularSoundChange",
      "baety:description": "Resistance to regular vowel loss"
    },
    {
      "@type": "baphon:SoundChange",
      "baety:hasSoundChangeType": "IrregularSoundChange",
      "baety:description": "Resistance to h-dropping"
    }
  ]
}
```

This follows RDF best practices while still allowing us to express multiple sound changes per etymology. Does this make more sense for the ontology design?

---

_**User**_

does the @etymology.jsonld ontology not already have properties that ought to fill this?

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes, you're right! Looking at the existing `etymology.jsonld`, we already have several relevant properties and classes that we should use instead of creating new ones:

1. We already have the classes:
```json
"IrregularSoundChange": {
  "@type": "owl:Class",
  "rdfs:subClassOf": "baphon:SoundChange",
  "rdfs:label": "Irregular Sound Change",
  "rdfs:comment": "A sound change that applies to specific words but not consistently across the lexicon"
}
```

2. And the property:
```json
"undergoes": {
  "@type": "owl:ObjectProperty",
  "rdfs:domain": "EtymologicalForm",
  "rdfs:range": "baphon:SoundChange",
  "rdfs:label": "Undergoes",
  "rdfs:comment": "Indicates a form underwent a specific sound change"
}
```

So instead of creating new properties, we should use these existing ones in our etymology documents. The `hahu` entry should use these established terms:

```json
{
  "@id": "ehketym:hahu",
  "@type": "baety:Etymology",
  "baety:derivedForm": {
    "@id": "ehk:hahu"
  },
  "baety:sourceForm": {
    "@id": "phk:hahu"
  },
  "baety:undergoes": {
    "@type": "baety:IrregularSoundChange",
    "rdfs:comment": "Resistance to regular sound changes due to sound symbolic nature"
  }
}
```

My apologies for suggesting new properties when we already had appropriate ones in the ontology! Should we update the other etymology entries to use these established properties more consistently?derivedForm` and `sourceForm`, we have:

```json

---

_**User**_

I also don't see the `derivedForm` and `sourceForm` properties in the ontology. are there correct properties?

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, you're right again! Looking at `etymology.jsonld`, for source and derived forms we actually have:

```json
"descendsFrom": {
  "@type": "owl:ObjectProperty",
  "rdfs:domain": "EtymologicalForm",
  "rdfs:range": "EtymologicalForm",
  "rdfs:label": "Descends From",
  "rdfs:comment": "Indicates direct ancestral relationship between forms"
},
"derives": {
  "@type": "owl:ObjectProperty",
  "rdfs:domain": "Etymology",
  "rdfs:range": "EtymologicalForm",
  "rdfs:label": "Derives",
  "rdfs:comment": "Indicates the ultimate source of a word"
}
```

So our `hahu` entry should use these established properties instead:

```json
{
  "@id": "ehketym:hahu",
  "@type": "baety:Etymology",
  "baety:derives": {
    "@id": "phk:hahu"
  },
  "baety:descendsFrom": {
    "@id": "phk:hahu"
  },
  "baety:undergoes": {
    "@type": "baety:IrregularSoundChange",
    "rdfs:comment": "Resistance to regular sound changes due to sound symbolic nature"
  }
}
```

Should we go through the other etymology documents and update them to use the correct properties from the ontology?

---

_**User**_

considering that the actual etymology documents use derivedFrom and sourceForm, maybe we can modify the ontology instead. tbh "derives" is confusing

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, you make a good point! The existing usage in the etymology documents is clearer and more intuitive. Let's modify `etymology.jsonld` to match the actual usage and replace the less clear properties.

We should add to the ontology:

```json
{
  "@id": "derivedForm",
  "@type": "owl:ObjectProperty",
  "rdfs:domain": "Etymology",
  "rdfs:range": "EtymologicalForm",
  "rdfs:label": "Derived Form",
  "rdfs:comment": "The resulting form after etymological development"
},
{
  "@id": "sourceForm",
  "@type": "owl:ObjectProperty",
  "rdfs:domain": "Etymology",
  "rdfs:range": "EtymologicalForm",
  "rdfs:label": "Source Form",
  "rdfs:comment": "The original form from which a word develops"
}
```

And remove/deprecate:
- `derives` (confusing)
- `descendsFrom` (redundant with sourceForm/derivedForm relationship)

This matches the actual usage in the documents and is more intuitive - `sourceForm` and `derivedForm` clearly show the direction of etymological development. Should we make this change to the ontology?

---

_**User**_

please apply the changes to @etymology.jsonld 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify `etymology.jsonld` to replace the confusing properties with the clearer ones. Here's the change to make in the properties section:

Remove these properties:
```json
{
  "@id": "descendsFrom",
  "@type": "owl:ObjectProperty",
  "rdfs:domain": "EtymologicalForm",
  "rdfs:range": "EtymologicalForm",
  "rdfs:label": "Descends From",
  "rdfs:comment": "Indicates direct ancestral relationship between forms"
},
{
  "@id": "derives",
  "@type": "owl:ObjectProperty",
  "rdfs:domain": "Etymology",
  "rdfs:range": "EtymologicalForm",
  "rdfs:label": "Derives",
  "rdfs:comment": "Indicates the ultimate source of a word"
}
```

And add these properties:
```json
{
  "@id": "derivedForm",
  "@type": "owl:ObjectProperty",
  "rdfs:domain": "Etymology",
  "rdfs:range": "EtymologicalForm",
  "rdfs:label": "Derived Form",
  "rdfs:comment": "The resulting form after etymological development"
},
{
  "@id": "sourceForm",
  "@type": "owl:ObjectProperty",
  "rdfs:domain": "Etymology",
  "rdfs:range": "EtymologicalForm",
  "rdfs:label": "Source Form",
  "rdfs:comment": "The original form from which a word develops"
}
```

This change:
1. Removes the confusing `derives` and redundant `descendsFrom`
2. Adds clearer `sourceForm` and `derivedForm` properties
3. Matches the actual usage in the etymology documents
4. Makes the direction of etymological development more intuitive

Would you like me to show how this would look in the complete `etymology.jsonld` file?

---

_**User**_

now let's apply `undergoes` to phk-etymology, and replace `soundChangeApplied`



---

_**Assistant**_

Yes! Looking at the `phk-etymology.jsonld`, we need to replace instances of `baety:soundChangeApplied` with `baety:undergoes`. For the `hahu` entry, it would change from:

```json
{
  "@id": "ehketym:hahu",
  "@type": "baety:Etymology",
  "baety:derivedForm": {
    "@id": "ehk:hahu"
  },
  "baety:sourceForm": {
    "@id": "phk:hahu"
  },
  "baety:soundChangeApplied": [
    "Preservation of form: hahu → hahu"
  ],
  "baety:hasPeriod": "c. 500-600 AI",
  "baety:hasEtymologicalNote": "One of few words to resist regular sound changes..."
}
```

to:

```json
{
  "@id": "ehketym:hahu",
  "@type": "baety:Etymology",
  "baety:derivedForm": {
    "@id": "ehk:hahu"
  },
  "baety:sourceForm": {
    "@id": "phk:hahu"
  },
  "baety:undergoes": {
    "@type": "baety:IrregularSoundChange",
    "rdfs:comment": "Preservation of form due to sound symbolic nature",
    "baety:results": {
      "@id": "ehk:hahu"
    }
  },
  "baety:hasPeriod": "c. 500-600 AI",
  "baety:hasEtymologicalNote": "One of few words to resist regular sound changes..."
}
```

This change:
1. Uses the proper `undergoes` property
2. Specifies it's an `IrregularSoundChange`
3. Uses `results` to show the outcome
4. Maintains the same etymological information but in the correct ontological structure

Would you like me to show how to update some of the other entries in `phk-etymology.jsonld` as well?

---

_**User**_

I suppose ones that go through multiple sound changes would have an array here right? also words that went through regular soung changes, do we still add them into individual words, or would the property for the EtymologyCollection be enough?

---

_**Assistant**_

Good questions! For both cases:

1. Multiple sound changes would indeed use an array:
```json
"baety:undergoes": [
  {
    "@type": "baety:RegularSoundChange",
    "rdfs:comment": "Final vowel dropping: taku → tak",
    "baety:results": {
      "@id": "ehk:tak"
    }
  },
  {
    "@type": "baety:RegularSoundChange",
    "rdfs:comment": "Stress shift to initial syllable",
    "baety:results": {
      "@id": "ehk:tak"
    }
  }
]
```

2. For regular sound changes, we have two options:
   - Keep them only in the `majorSoundChanges` at the collection level (cleaner, avoids repetition)
   - Document them both at collection level AND individual word level (more verbose but shows exact chain of changes for each word)

I think the best practice would be:
- Keep regular sound changes only at collection level UNLESS
  - The word shows an interesting interaction between multiple regular changes
  - The application of regular changes needs special documentation
  - The word demonstrates a particularly clear example of a sound change

So for `hahu` we document its irregular resistance to change, but for a word like `tak` that just follows regular patterns, we'd let the collection-level documentation handle it.

Does this approach make sense for balancing completeness with practicality?

---

_**User**_

so in this document, we can remove all of the `soundChangeApplied` props in each Etymology that merely repeat established sound changes. those that aren't may represent irregular sound changes, or simply state out of date information, so we can get to that after

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes exactly! Let's first do a clean sweep of all the `soundChangeApplied` properties that just repeat the regular changes documented in `majorSoundChanges`. 

For example, entries like:
```json
{
  "@id": "ehketym:taku",
  "@type": "baety:Etymology",
  "baety:derivedForm": {
    "@id": "ehk:tak"
  },
  "baety:sourceForm": {
    "@id": "phk:taku"
  },
  "baety:soundChangeApplied": [
    "Final vowel dropping: taku → tak"  // This is just repeating a major sound change
  ],
  "baety:hasPeriod": "c. 500-600 AI"
}
```

Can be simplified to:
```json
{
  "@id": "ehketym:taku",
  "@type": "baety:Etymology",
  "baety:derivedForm": {
    "@id": "ehk:tak"
  },
  "baety:sourceForm": {
    "@id": "phk:taku"
  },
  "baety:hasPeriod": "c. 500-600 AI"
}
```

Then we can review what's left and:
1. Convert genuine irregular changes to use `undergoes`
2. Update any out-of-date information
3. Document any special interactions between regular changes that need noting

Would you like me to start identifying which entries have `soundChangeApplied` that can be safely removed?

---

_**User**_

yes please, let's get started

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll go through the `@graph` array in `phk-etymology.jsonld` and identify entries where `soundChangeApplied` just repeats regular changes from `majorSoundChanges`. Looking at the major sound changes documented:

```json
"baety:majorSoundChanges": [
  {
    "@type": "baety:RegularSoundChange",
    "dc:description": "Final vowel dropping",
    "baety:soundChangeRule": "V → ∅ / _#",
    "baety:example": "heru → her → er"
  },
  {
    "@type": "baety:RegularSoundChange",
    "dc:description": "Initial h-dropping",
    "baety:soundChangeRule": "h → ∅ / #_",
    "baety:example": "heru → eru → er"
  },
  {
    "@type": "baety:RegularSoundChange",
    "dc:description": "Medial consonant cluster simplification",
    "baety:soundChangeRule": "C₁C₂ → C₁ or C₂ / V_V"
  },
  {
    "@type": "baety:RegularSoundChange",
    "dc:description": "Animacy prefix retention as glottal stop",
    "baety:soundChangeRule": "hi- → ʔi- / #_"
  },
  {
    "@type": "baety:RegularSoundChange",
    "dc:description": "Vowel contraction",
    "baety:soundChangeRule": "VhV → V"
  }
]
```

Here are the first few entries we can simplify by removing redundant `soundChangeApplied`:

1. `ehketym:heru`:
```json
{
  "@id": "ehketym:heru",
  "@type": "baety:Etymology",
  "baety:derivedForm": {
    "@id": "ehk:er"
  },
  "baety:sourceForm": {
    "@id": "phk:heru"
  },
  "baety:hasPeriod": "c. 500-600 AI"
}
```

2. `ehketym:taku`:
```json
{
  "@id": "ehketym:taku",
  "@type": "baety:Etymology",
  "baety:derivedForm": {
    "@id": "ehk:tak"
  },
  "baety:sourceForm": {
    "@id": "phk:taku"
  },
  "baety:hasPeriod": "c. 500-600 AI"
}
```

3. `ehketym:xasamu` needs review because it mentions "Initial fricative loss" which isn't in the major changes:
```json
{
  "@id": "ehketym:xasamu",
  "@type": "baety:Etymology",
  "baety:derivedForm": {
    "@id": "ehk:asam"
  },
  "baety:sourceForm": {
    "@id": "phk:xasamu"
  },
  "baety:undergoes": {
    "@type": "baety:RegularSoundChange",
    "rdfs:comment": "Initial fricative loss: xasamu → asamu"
  },
  "baety:hasPeriod": "c. 500-600 AI",
  "baety:hasEtymologicalNote": "Also the source of the subessive case marker -asam"
}
```

Should I continue with more entries? Also, should we add "Initial fricative loss" to the `majorSoundChanges` since it seems to be a regular pattern?

---

_**User**_

I think that sound change is out of date. it's not in @early-hick.lsc . I think we have a more complex pathway to losing initial fricative now

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes, looking at `early-hick.lsc`, we have more specific rules about initial fricatives. The relevant rules seem to be:

```
initial-glottal-devoicing:
  [voiced glottal] => [unvoiced glottal] / $ _ @vowel
  Then: (
    [unvoiced glottal] => ʔ / $ _ i # voiced glottals don't trigger animacy deletion
    [unvoiced glottal] => ʔ / $ _ a # voiced glottals don't trigger sacred θ
  )

initial-glottal-fricative-deletion:
  [unvoiced glottal fricative] => * / $ _ @vowel&![+high]

initial-glottal-stop-deletion:
  [unvoiced glottal stop] => * / $ _ @vowel
```

So for `xasamu`, we should:
1. Remove the outdated "Initial fricative loss" sound change
2. Either document the actual pathway through these rules if it's interesting/complex enough, or
3. Just let the major sound changes handle it if it follows the regular pattern

Would you like me to show how we should update the `xasamu` entry based on these rules?

---

_**User**_

let's first see if we have all the major sound changes from the lexurgy file @early-hick.lsc it would be all of the rules since we're in the phk-ehk etymology document

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, good idea! Let's go through `early-hick.lsc` and make sure all the major sound changes are properly documented. The file shows stages 0-4, and since this is Proto-Hick to Early Hick, we need all of them. Here are the major rules:

Stage 1 (Proto-Maritime Hick):
```
- h-liquid-cleanup
- liquid-cluster-cleanup
- compound-vowel-deletion
- compound-nasal-liquid-deletion
- initial-fricative-change-sacred
- initial-glottal-devoicing
```

Stage 2 (Proto-Seneran Hick):
```
- unstressed-vowel-reduction
- initial-fricative-vowel-fronting
- final-vowel-centralization
```

Stage 3 (Pre-Hick):
```
- final-glide-vocalization
- diphthong-repair
- nucleus-repair
- initial-glottal-fricative-deletion
- initial-glottal-stop-deletion
- animacy-marker-change
- dental-fricative-cluster-formation
- vowel-coalescence
- initial-h-before-consonant-cleanup
- coda-simplification
- metathesis-complex-cluster-simplification
- first-syllable-syncope
- back-vowel-reduction-after-velar-stop
```

Stage 4 (Early Hick):
```
- glottal-devoicing
- cluster-resolution
- final-vowel-transposition
- final-vowel-reduction
```

Comparing this with what's in `majorSoundChanges` in the etymology document, we're missing quite a few! Should we update the `majorSoundChanges` section to include all these rules?

---

_**User**_

yes please

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll draft an updated `majorSoundChanges` section for `phk-etymology.jsonld` that covers all the stages from `early-hick.lsc`:

      }
    ]
  }
]
```

This organization:
1. Groups changes by historical stage
2. Includes the formal rule and an example for each change
3. Shows the progression from Proto-Hick to Early Hick
4. Preserves the ordering from the Lexurgy file

Would you like me to add any additional information or reorganize this structure?

---

_**User**_

I don't think we have this kind of structure in @etymology.jsonld 

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, you're right! Looking at `etymology.jsonld`, we don't have a defined structure for grouping sound changes by stages. We have:

1. The basic `RegularSoundChange` and `IrregularSoundChange` classes
2. Properties like `undergoes` and `results`
3. But no defined way to group changes into chronological stages

We should add to `etymology.jsonld`:

```json
{
  "@id": "SoundChangeStage",
  "@type": "owl:Class",
  "rdfs:subClassOf": "ChronologicalStage",
  "rdfs:label": "Sound Change Stage",
  "rdfs:comment": "A distinct period of sound changes in a language's development"
},
{
  "@id": "hasSoundChanges",
  "@type": "owl:ObjectProperty",

Should we add these to properly support the stage-based organization we're using in the etymology documents?

---

_**User**_

yes, I think this is fine

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! Let me add those classes and properties to `etymology.jsonld`, and then we can revise the `majorSoundChanges` in `phk-etymology.jsonld` to use this proper structure. 

After adding those new definitions to `etymology.jsonld`, the `majorSoundChanges` in `phk-etymology.jsonld` should look like:

```json
"baety:hasStage": [
  {
    "@type": "baety:SoundChangeStage",
    "rdfs:label": "Proto-Maritime Hick",
    "baety:hasPeriod": "c. 500-550 AI",
    "baety:hasSoundChanges": [
      {
        "@type": "baety:RegularSoundChange",
        "rdfs:label": "h-liquid cleanup",
        "baety:soundChangeRule": "h [liquid] → h * / _; [liquid] h → * h / _",
        "baety:example": "heru → heu"
      },
      {
        "@type": "baety:RegularSoundChange",
        "rdfs:label": "liquid cluster cleanup",
        "baety:soundChangeRule": "[liquid] l → l * / _",
        "baety:example": "melisu → mesu"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "@type": "baety:SoundChangeStage",
    "rdfs:label": "Proto-Seneran Hick",
    "baety:hasPeriod": "c. 550-600 AI",
    "baety:hasSoundChanges": [
      {
        "@type": "baety:RegularSoundChange",
        "rdfs:label": "unstressed vowel reduction",
        "baety:soundChangeRule": "[+low] → ə / [unstressed] _",
        "baety:example": "hasa → həsa"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

(I've shown just a few example changes for brevity)

This structure:
1. Uses the new `SoundChangeStage` class
2. Properly links stages to their changes
3. Includes period information
4. Maintains the chronological organization

Should I continue with the full list of changes in this new format?

---

_**User**_

baety:majorSoundChanges doesn't seem to be defined in @etymology.jsonld as well. can we do so with multiple ranges? 

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, we should define `majorSoundChanges` in `etymology.jsonld`, and we can use multiple ranges in OWL. Here's how we should add it:

```json
{
  "@id": "majorSoundChanges",
  "@type": "owl:ObjectProperty",
  "rdfs:domain": "EtymologyCollection",
  "rdfs:range": [
    "baphon:SoundChange",
    "SoundChangeStage"
  ],
  "rdfs:label": "Major Sound Changes",
  "rdfs:comment": "The major sound changes that occurred during a language's development, either as individual changes or organized into stages"
}
```

This allows `majorSoundChanges` to contain either:
1. Direct sound changes (using `baphon:SoundChange`)
2. Staged changes (using `SoundChangeStage`)

This flexibility means we can document sound changes either way depending on our needs. Should I add this to `etymology.jsonld`?

---

_**User**_

should we define SoundChangeStage in the @etymology.jsonld ontology, or would if fit @phonology.jsonld better? to be in the same place as SoundChange classes? 

hmm on the other hand, SoundChangeStages _are_ more associated with historical evolution of sounds, which may make more sense in the etymology ontology... what do you think?

---

_**Assistant**_

This is a good ontological design question! Let's think about it:

Arguments for `phonology.jsonld`:
1. It already has `SoundChange` and related classes
2. Keeps all sound-related concepts together
3. Could be reused for synchronic phonological processes too

Arguments for `etymology.jsonld`:
1. Stages are inherently diachronic/historical
2. Already has `ChronologicalStage` which `SoundChangeStage` extends
3. More about the evolution of language over time than pure phonology
4. Other etymology collections might want to reference sound change stages
5. Fits with other historical linguistic concepts in the etymology ontology

I lean towards keeping it in `etymology.jsonld` because:
1. The primary purpose is tracking historical development
2. It's more about organizing changes over time than describing the changes themselves
3. The actual sound changes are still defined in `phonology.jsonld`, we're just providing a way to organize them historically
4. It maintains a clean separation: phonology describes what changes are, etymology describes how they unfold over time

What do you think about this reasoning? The key seems to be that while it deals with sound changes, its primary purpose is historical organization rather than phonological description.

---

_**User**_

I agree with your reasoning. now here's what we want to do:

1. take the sound changes in @early-hick.lsc , and figure what type of sound changes they are relative to the ones defined in the @phonology.jsonld ontology
2. add them into the @phk-etymology.jsonld 
3. actually define the baety:majorSoundChanges property in the @etymology.jsonld ontology, since it seems to be missing.

---

_**Assistant**_

Great plan! Let's tackle these in order:

1. First, let's map some of the Lexurgy rules to the sound change types in `phonology.jsonld`:

```
Stage 1 (Proto-Maritime Hick):
- h-liquid-cleanup: Elision ("deletion of a sound in specific environment")
- liquid-cluster-cleanup: Elision
- compound-vowel-deletion: Elision
- compound-nasal-liquid-deletion: Elision
- initial-fricative-change-sacred: Fortition (strengthening in word-initial)
- initial-glottal-devoicing: Dissimilation

Stage 2 (Proto-Seneran Hick):
- unstressed-vowel-reduction: Lenition (weakening)
- initial-fricative-vowel-fronting: Assimilation
- final-vowel-centralization: Lenition

Stage 3 (Pre-Hick):
- final-glide-vocalization: Lenition
- initial-glottal-fricative-deletion: Elision
- initial-glottal-stop-deletion: Elision
- animacy-marker-change: CompensatoryLengthening
- dental-fricative-cluster-formation: Fortition
- vowel-coalescence: Vocalic
- coda-simplification: Lenition
- metathesis-complex-cluster-simplification: Metathesis
- first-syllable-syncope: Elision
- back-vowel-reduction-after-velar-stop: Assimilation

Stage 4 (Early Hick):
- glottal-devoicing: Dissimilation
- cluster-resolution: Metathesis
- final-vowel-reduction: Elision
```

Would you like me to proceed with adding these to `phk-etymology.jsonld` using the stage structure we discussed, or should we first define `majorSoundChanges` in the ontology?

---

_**User**_

I'm unsure how stage 4 glottal devoicing is a  Dissimilation process?

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, you're right! Looking at the rule in `early-hick.lsc`:

```
glottal-devoicing:
  [voiced glottal] => [unvoiced glottal] / _ @vowel
```

This is actually a case of Lenition - it's a weakening process where voiced glottals become voiceless before vowels. I incorrectly categorized it as Dissimilation.

Devoicing is typically considered a form of lenition in phonology because:
1. Voiced sounds require more articulatory effort than voiceless ones
2. The change reduces the marked/complex feature (voicing) to a simpler one
3. It's especially common in weak positions (like intervocalic)

So in our mapping, we should change:
```diff
Stage 4 (Early Hick):
- glottal-devoicing: Dissimilation
+ glottal-devoicing: Lenition
  cluster-resolution: Metathesis
  final-vowel-reduction: Elision
```

Would you like me to continue with the rest of the categorization, or should we review any other sound changes that might need recategorization?

---

_**User**_

can we redo step 1, with @early-hick.lsc ?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You're right. Let's look at `early-hick.lsc` more carefully and properly categorize each sound change rule according to the `phonology.jsonld` ontology classes:

### Stage 1: Proto-Maritime Hick

```
h-liquid-cleanup:
  h [liquid] => h * / _
  [liquid] h => * h / _
```
**Type**: Elision (deletion of liquids in certain environments)

```
liquid-cluster-cleanup:
  [liquid] l => l * / _
```
**Type**: Elision (deletion of first liquid in a sequence)

```
compound-vowel-deletion:
  @consonant @vowel => @consonant * / _ $$
```
**Type**: Elision (deletion of vowels at compound boundaries)

```
compound-nasal-liquid-deletion:
  {[nasal], [liquid]} => * / @consonant @vowel? $$ _ 
  {[nasal], [liquid]} => * / _ $$ @consonant
```
**Type**: Elision (deletion of nasals/liquids at compound boundaries)

```
initial-fricative-change-sacred:
  ha => θə / $ _ {[stop !glottal], [fricative], [liquid], [glide]}
```
**Type**: Fortition (strengthening of initial `h` to dental fricative)

```
initial-glottal-devoicing:
  [voiced glottal] => [unvoiced glottal] / $ _ @vowel
```
**Type**: Lenition (voiced to unvoiced is a weakening process)

### Stage 2: Proto-Seneran Hick

```
unstressed-vowel-reduction:
  [+high +front] => i / [unstressed] _
  [+high +back] => u / [unstressed] _
  [+low] => ə / [unstressed] _
```
**Type**: Vocalic (vowel reduction in unstressed positions)

```
initial-fricative-vowel-fronting:
  {ə, e} => i / $ [fricative] _
```
**Type**: Assimilation (vowels becoming more similar to the frontal articulation of preceding fricatives)

```
final-vowel-centralization:
  [+high +back] => [-high +mid -back +central] / _ $
  [+mid +front] => [-low -front +central] / _ $
```
**Type**: Vocalic (vowel centralization)

### Stage 3: Pre-Hick

```
final-glide-vocalization:
  w => u / _ $
```
**Type**: Vocalic (glide becoming a vowel)

```
initial-glottal-fricative-deletion:
  [unvoiced glottal fricative] => * / $ _ @vowel&![+high]
```
**Type**: Elision (deletion of initial `h` before non-high vowels)

```
initial-glottal-stop-deletion:
  [unvoiced glottal stop] => * / $ _ @vowel
```
**Type**: Elision (deletion of initial glottal stop before vowels)

```
animacy-marker-change:
  hi => ʔi / $ _ {[+high], @consonant&![glottal stop]}
```
**Type**: Assimilation (change of `h` to glottal stop)

```
dental-fricative-cluster-formation:
  θ @vowel => θ * / $ _ r @vowel
```
**Type**: Elision (vowel deletion to create consonant clusters)

```
vowel-coalescence:
  @vowel {h,l} => @vowel * / _ @vowel
  @vowel @vowel => @vowel * / _ @consonant
```
**Type**: Vocalic (vowel simplification)

```
coda-simplification:
  [liquid] [nasal] => [liquid] * 
  [nasal] [liquid] => * [liquid]
```
**Type**: Elision (deletion in consonant clusters)

```
metathesis-complex-cluster-simplification:
  @vowel$1 @consonant$2 => $2 $1 / $ _ @finalcluster
```
**Type**: Metathesis (transposition of vowel and consonant)

```
first-syllable-syncope:
  {p,b,k,t,s,θ} @vowel => {p,b,k,t,s,θ} * / $ _ {k,t,n,r} <syl>
```
**Type**: Elision (vowel syncope/deletion)

### Stage 4: Early Hick

```
glottal-devoicing:
  [voiced glottal] => [unvoiced glottal] / _ @vowel
```
**Type**: Lenition (devoicing is typically considered weakening)

```
cluster-resolution:
  # Various rules for reordering consonant clusters
  {b,t,θ,k}$1 a r => $1 r a / _ {s,t,k}
```
**Type**: Metathesis (reordering of segments in clusters)

```
final-vowel-transposition:
  {p,b,k,t,θ}$1 {r,n,t,k}$2 ə => $1 ə $2 / _ $
```
**Type**: Metathesis (reordering of final consonant and schwa)

```
final-vowel-reduction:
  h ə => * ə / _ $
  ə => * / _ $ 
```
**Type**: Elision (deletion of final vowels)

This more careful analysis should give us a better classification of each sound change according to the phonology ontology.

_**User**_

let's quickly define majorSoundChanges in the @etymology.jsonld ontology first if there are no properties that fill the role.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Let's add the `majorSoundChanges` property to `etymology.jsonld`. I don't see any existing property that fills this role, so we need to define it. Here's the definition to add:

```json
{
  "@id": "majorSoundChanges",
  "@type": "owl:ObjectProperty",
  "rdfs:domain": "EtymologyCollection",
  "rdfs:range": [
    "baphon:SoundChange", 
    "SoundChangeStage"
  ],
  "rdfs:label": "Major Sound Changes",
  "rdfs:comment": "Documents the significant sound changes that characterize a language's development from its ancestor"
}
```

This property:
1. Has domain `EtymologyCollection` so it can be applied to collections like Proto-Hick to Early Hick
2. Has multiple ranges: can point to individual sound changes or to stages of changes
3. Clearly indicates its purpose for documenting the definitive sound changes

Now we can update `phk-etymology.jsonld` to use this property with our properly categorized sound changes.

This structured representation:
1. Organizes sound changes into their chronological stages
2. Properly categorizes each change according to the phonology ontology
3. Provides the formal rule and an example for each change
4. Shows the progression from Proto-Hick to Early Hick

Should we now update the individual etymology entries in `phk-etymology.jsonld` to use `undergoes` instead of `soundChangeApplied`?

ok, I thought you said that there was no property that would fit the "majorSoundChanges" prop? but actually hasStage and hasSoundChanges fill the role separately

You're absolutely right! I misunderstood our existing structure. Looking at the file now, I see we actually already have the perfect properties:

1. `hasStage` links the etymology collection to the chronological stages
2. `hasSoundChanges` links each stage to its specific sound changes

This combination already provides exactly what we need - a way to organize sound changes into chronological periods without needing an additional property. And looking at the file, we've already implemented this structure correctly!

The changes are now properly:
1. Organized into their four chronological stages
2. Categorized by sound change type (Elision, Vocalic, Metathesis, etc.)
3. Documented with their environments and examples

So there's no need to define `majorSoundChanges` after all. We should now just focus on updating any individual etymologies in the `@graph` section that still use the old `soundChangeApplied` property instead of `undergoes`.
