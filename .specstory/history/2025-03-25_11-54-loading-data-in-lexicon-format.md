# Loading Data in Lexicon Format (2025-03-25 19:54:05)

_**User**_

can we load data in a similar fashion as these sections of the lexicon I added to context above, with @early-hick lexicon-earlyhick-*-alphabetical.json?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you understand how to load data in a similar fashion. First, I'll examine the pattern and structure of the existing lexicon files.


---

Read file: site/content/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon-earlyhick_a-alphabetical.json

---

Yes, we can load data in a similar fashion! The pattern used in the lexicon.md file is using Zola's shortcode syntax to load JSON data. Here's how it works:

1. The syntax is:
```markdown
{{ lexicon(path="path/to/file.json", format="json") }}
```

2. The files follow a consistent naming pattern:
- `lexicon-earlyhick_X-alphabetical.json` where X is the letter section
- For suffixes, it uses `lexicon-earlyhick_--alphabetical.json`

3. The JSON files contain structured lexicon data with:
- Entry IDs
- Written forms
- Phonetic forms
- Proto-forms
- Definitions
- Semantic fields
- And other linguistic metadata

To add more sections, you would follow the same pattern. For example, to add the 'B' section:

```markdown
## B

{{ lexicon(path="content/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon-earlyhick_b-alphabetical.json", format="json") }}
```

The key points to remember are:
1. Use the correct relative path from the content directory
2. Keep the format="json" parameter
3. Make sure the JSON files exist and follow the expected structure
4. The section headers should match the letter being loaded

Would you like me to help you add any specific sections to the lexicon?

_**User**_

this is correct, please apply the missing ones into @lexicon.md 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add the missing letter sections to the lexicon.md file. First, let me check what sections are already present and what needs to be added.


---

Read file: site/content/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon.md

---

I'll now edit the file to add all the missing letter sections. Looking at the directory listing, we have JSON files for all letters from A through W, plus the suffixes section.

I've added all the missing letter sections to the lexicon.md file. The changes include:

1. Added sections for all letters that have corresponding JSON files (B through W)
2. Maintained the same format and structure as the existing sections
3. Each section follows the pattern:
   ```markdown
   ## [LETTER]
   
   {{ lexicon(path="content/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick/lexicon-earlyhick_[letter]-alphabetical.json", format="json") }}
   ```
4. Preserved the existing Suffixes and A sections

The lexicon should now be complete with all available sections. Each section will load its corresponding JSON data when the page is rendered. Is there anything specific you'd like me to check or modify in the updated file?
