## Comparative Constructions Across Languages (1/17/2025, 11:12:21 PM)

_**User**_

while we do have a comparative construction for similarity, as X as Y, we don't have comparisons X greater than Y etc. What are different strategies and  examples from different IRL languages to do comparisons?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me share some interesting strategies for comparative constructions from different languages. I'll focus on ones that could fit Early Hick's ergative-absolutive alignment and cultural context.

1. Locational/Spatial Strategy (like Japanese より yori, Tibetan བས bas)
```plaintext
X is tall FROM Y
X is strong ABOVE Y
```
This would work well with Early Hick's spatial cases:
```plaintext
tores torimris males
mountain-ABS height-ELL pool-ABS
"The mountain is taller than the pool"
(lit. "mountain from-height pool")
```

2. Exceed/Surpass Construction (like Mandarin 超过 chaoguo, Thai กว่า gwaa)
```plaintext
X EXCEEDS Y in-tallness
X SURPASSES Y in-strength
```
Early Hick could use ter'er "flow" metaphorically:
```plaintext
torel terimris males toriter
mountain-ERG flow-ELL pool-ABS height-VERB
"The mountain exceeds the pool in height"
(lit. "mountain flows-from pool in-height")
```

3. Conjoined Polarity (like Mayan languages)
```plaintext
X is-tall, Y not-is-tall
X is-strong, Y not-is-strong
```
For Early Hick:
```plaintext
tores toriter, males moter
mountain-ABS height-VERB, pool-ABS NEG-flow
"The mountain is taller than the pool"
(lit. "mountain heights, pool doesn't-flow")
```

4. Ablative/Source Construction (like Turkish -dan, Finnish -lta)
```plaintext
X is-tall FROM Y
X has-strength FROM Y
```
This aligns well with Early Hick's ellative case:
```plaintext
tores toriter malesimris
mountain-ABS height-VERB pool-ELL
"The mountain is taller than the pool"
(lit. "mountain heights from-pool")
```

5. Taking/Defeating Metaphor (like some Niger-Congo languages)
```plaintext
X takes Y in-tallness
X defeats Y in-strength
```
Early Hick could use ward'er "guide/lead":
```plaintext
torel wardes males toriter
mountain-ERG guide-ABS pool-ABS height-VERB
"The mountain is taller than the pool"
(lit. "mountain guides pool in-height")
```

Given Early Hick's:
- Ergative-absolutive alignment
- Rich spatial case system
- Maritime/flow metaphors
- Cultural emphasis on guidance/leadership

I would recommend either:

1. The Spatial/Ellative strategy:
```plaintext
tores toriter malesimris
mountain-ABS height-VERB pool-ELL
"The mountain is taller than the pool"
```

Or 

2. The Flow/Exceed metaphor:
```plaintext
torel terimris males toriter
mountain-ERG flow-ELL pool-ABS height-VERB
"The mountain exceeds the pool in height"
```

Both of these:
- Use existing case marking patterns
- Align with the language's metaphorical systems
- Fit the cultural context
- Are typologically plausible

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these strategies or explore how they might interact with other aspects of Early Hick grammar?

_**User**_

I have considered using SUBE and SUPE for these, but I suppose we'll need to have some syntactic structure to it. would it be sequential?

x-itar y: x > y
x-asam y: x < y
kas x y: x = y

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, using SUPE (-itar) and SUBE (-asam) for comparisons would be very fitting for Early Hick! It aligns well with the language's spatial metaphors and existing case system. Let's explore this structure:

1. Greater Than (-itar "upon/above"):
````plaintext
tores toriter malitar
mountain-ABS height-VERB pool-SUPE
"The mountain is taller than the pool"
(lit. "mountain heights above-pool")

'alel vinuiter 'altanitar
person-ERG birth-VERB man-SUPE
"The person is older than the man"
(lit. "person births above-man")
````

2. Less Than (-asam "under/below"):
````plaintext
males toriter torasam
pool-ABS height-VERB mountain-SUBE
"The pool is less tall than the mountain"
(lit. "pool heights under-mountain")

'altanes vinuiter 'alasam
man-ABS birth-VERB person-SUBE
"The man is younger than the person"
(lit. "man births under-person")
````

3. Equal To (kas):
````plaintext
kas males tores toriter
LIKE pool-ABS mountain-ABS height-VERB
"The pool is as tall as the mountain"
(lit. "like pool mountain heights")
````

This system:
- Uses existing spatial metaphors consistently
- Maintains ergative-absolutive alignment
- Creates clear semantic oppositions
- Integrates with the existing kas equality marker

We could also have interesting interactions with other aspects of the grammar:

1. With temporal expressions:
````plaintext
branum 'ales vinuiter 'altanitar
PAST person-ABS birth-VERB man-SUPE
"The person was older than the man"
````

2. With negation:
````plaintext
males motoriter torasam
pool-ABS NEG-height-VERB mountain-SUBE
"The pool is not less tall than the mountain"
````

3. With multiple comparisons:
````plaintext
tores toriter [malitar ru kethitar]
mountain-ABS height-VERB [pool-SUPE AND sea-SUPE]
"The mountain is taller than both the pool and the sea"
````

Would you like me to explore any particular aspect of this system in more detail?

---

_**User**_

so basically stative verb with two arguments, the SUPE/SUBE marks the comparator, takes the role of the ergative, and the absolutive is the comparable? 

---

_**Assistant**_



Yes, exactly! This is a really insightful analysis. The comparison construction would be treating the stative verb as essentially transitive, where:

- The comparable (what's being compared) takes absolutive case
- The comparator (what it's being compared to) takes SUPE/SUBE
- The stative verb describes the quality being compared

So structurally:
````plaintext
COMPARABLE-ABS QUALITY-VERB COMPARATOR-SUPE/SUBE
````

Examples:
````plaintext
tores      toriter    malitar
mountain-ABS height-VERB pool-SUPE
"The mountain is taller than the pool"
(lit. "mountain heights above-pool")

males      toriter    torasam
pool-ABS    height-VERB mountain-SUBE
"The pool is shorter than the mountain"
(lit. "pool heights under-mountain")
````

This aligns nicely with Early Hick's ergative-absolutive system because:
1. The comparable (absolutive) is like the patient of a transitive verb
2. The comparator (SUPE/SUBE) takes a role similar to the ergative agent
3. The stative verb maintains its verbal properties

It's also typologically plausible - many languages treat comparisons as 
transitive constructions, just with different case marking strategies for the 
comparator.

Would you like to explore how this interacts with other aspects of Early Hick's 
grammar, like complex predicates or embedded clauses?

---

_**User**_

I suppose we should check how it works with embedded clauses

---

_**Assistant**_



Yes, let's explore how comparisons work in embedded clauses! Here are several key scenarios:

1. Relative Clauses with Comparisons:
````plaintext
'altanel ['alises toriter malitar] ward'er
man-MED.VIS.ANIM [who-ABS height-VERB pool-SUPE] guide-VERB
"That man who is taller than the pool guides"

materok-el ['alises thren'er toresitar] ward'er
handler-ERG [who-ABS watch-VERB mountain-SUPE] guide-VERB
"The handler who watches more than the mountain guides"
````

2. Complement Clauses:
````plaintext
'al'isel hilis'er ['ales toriter malitar]
person-ERG see-VERB [person-ABS height-VERB pool-SUPE]
"I see that the person is taller than the pool"

'al'isel pak'er ['ales vinuiter 'altanasam]
person-ERG say-VERB [person-ABS birth-VERB man-SUBE]
"I say that the person is younger than the man"
````

3. Nested Comparisons:
````plaintext
'ales toriter ['alises vinuiter 'altanitar]itar
person-ABS height-VERB [who-ABS birth-VERB man-SUPE]-SUPE
"The person is taller than who is older than the man"
````

4. With Temporal Clauses:
````plaintext
'aterimris ['ales toriter malitar], 'altanes ward'er
after [person-ABS height-VERB pool-SUPE], man-ABS guide-VERB
"After the person became taller than the pool, the man guided"
````

5. With Causal Clauses:
````plaintext
imris ['ales toriter malitar], 'altanes ward'er
because [person-ABS height-VERB pool-SUPE], man-ABS guide-VERB
"Because the person is taller than the pool, the man guides"
````

The pattern maintains consistency with:
- Case marking in embedded clauses
- Regular subordination patterns
- Relative clause formation
- Information structure

Would you like to explore any particular type of embedding in more detail?

---

_**User**_

one thing, is that you're marking VERB with iter instead of the correct 'er

---

_**Assistant**_



Ah, you're absolutely right - I apologize for that error! The verbalizer is -'er, not -iter. Let me correct those examples:

1. Basic Relative Clause:
````plaintext
'altanel ['alises tor'er malitar] ward'er
man-MED.VIS.ANIM [who-ABS height-VERB pool-SUPE] guide-VERB
"That man who is taller than the pool guides"
````

2. Complement Clause:
````plaintext
'al'isel hilis'er ['ales tor'er malitar]
person-ERG see-VERB [person-ABS height-VERB pool-SUPE]
"I see that the person is taller than the pool"

'al'isel pak'er ['ales vinu'er 'altanasam]
person-ERG say-VERB [person-ABS birth-VERB man-SUBE]
"I say that the person is younger than the man"
````

3. Nested Comparison:
````plaintext
'ales tor'er ['alises vinu'er 'altanitar]itar
person-ABS height-VERB [who-ABS birth-VERB man-SUPE]-SUPE
"The person is taller than who is older than the man"
````

The -iter I was using incorrectly is actually the inland dialect variant of the ellative case (-imris). Thank you for catching this error! Would you like to continue exploring embedded comparisons with the correct verbalizer?

---

_**User**_

I don't think we've ever documented a complement clause. we can explore that in a bit, but let's document the comparative structure

---

_**Assistant**_



Yes, let's document the comparative structure in Early Hick! I'll draft a section that could fit into the grammar documentation:

````markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
// ... existing code ...

## Comparative Constructions

Early Hick expresses comparisons through a specialized construction using its 
spatial case system. The construction treats comparisons as stative predicates 
with two arguments:

1. The comparable (what's being compared) takes absolutive case
2. The comparator (what it's compared to) takes either superessive (-itar) or 
   subessive (-asam) case
3. The quality being compared is expressed as a stative verb with -'er

### Greater Than

Uses the superessive case (-itar "upon/above"):

```plaintext
tores tor'er malitar
mountain-ABS height-VERB pool-SUPE
"The mountain is taller than the pool"
(lit. "mountain heights above-pool")

'ales vinu'er 'altanitar
person-ABS birth-VERB man-SUPE
"The person is older than the man"
(lit. "person births above-man")
```

### Less Than

Uses the subessive case (-asam "under/below"):

```plaintext
males tor'er torasam
pool-ABS height-VERB mountain-SUBE
"The pool is less tall than the mountain"
(lit. "pool heights under-mountain")

'altanes vinu'er 'alasam
man-ABS birth-VERB person-SUBE
"The man is younger than the person"
(lit. "man births under-person")
```

### Equality

Uses the comparative particle kas (see: [Comparative Markers](#development-of-comparative-markers)):

```plaintext
kas males tores tor'er
LIKE pool-ABS mountain-ABS height-VERB
"The pool is as tall as the mountain"
(lit. "like pool mountain heights")
```

### Syntactic Properties

The comparative construction shows several important properties:

1. Case Alignment
   - Comparable takes absolutive case (-es)
   - Comparator takes spatial case (-itar/-asam)
   - Maintains ergative-absolutive alignment pattern

2. Word Order
   - Basic order: COMPARABLE-ABS QUALITY-VERB COMPARATOR-SUPE/SUBE
   - Follows standard clause structure flexibility

3. Multiple Comparators
   - Can be coordinated with ru:
   ```plaintext
   tores tor'er [malitar ru kethitar]
   mountain-ABS height-VERB [pool-SUPE AND sea-SUPE]
   "The mountain is taller than both the pool and the sea"
   ```

4. Negation
   - Negates the stative verb with mo-:
   ```plaintext
   males motor'er torasam
   pool-ABS NEG-height-VERB mountain-SUBE
   "The pool is not less tall than the mountain"
   ```

5. Temporal Reference
   - Takes standard temporal markers:
   ```plaintext
   branum 'ales vinu'er 'altanitar
   PAST person-ABS birth-VERB man-SUPE
   "The person was older than the man"
   ```

// ... existing code ...
````

Would you like me to expand on any particular aspect of this documentation or add more examples?

---

_**User**_

is already existing Comparative Constructions section actually demonstrating a Comparative Construction, but in a different way than what we're talking about right now?

---

_**Assistant**_



Looking at the existing code, yes! The current section under "Comparative Constructions" actually documents a different type of comparison - one of similarity/equivalence using `ka-` and `kas`, derived from Proto-Hick *kasu "reflection". 

So we actually have two different types of comparative constructions:

1. Similarity/Equivalence (existing)
- Uses `ka-` prefix for simple comparisons
- Uses `kas` conjunction for complex phrases
- Expresses "X is like Y" or "X is as Y as Z"

2. Relative Degree (new)
- Uses spatial cases (-itar/-asam)
- Expresses "X is more/less Y than Z"

We should probably rename the existing section to "Similarity Constructions" or "Equative Constructions" and add our new section as "Comparative Degree Constructions". Would you like me to draft how these sections should be reorganized?

---

_**User**_

Would it be better to rename it, or integrate it all under comparative constructions with subsections for similarity/equivalence and relative degree?

---

_**Assistant**_





Yes, integrating them under a single "Comparative Constructions" section would be better! It would show how Early Hick handles all types of comparison systematically. Here's a proposed organization:

````markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
## Comparative Constructions

Early Hick has two primary strategies for expressing comparisons: similarity/
equivalence marking and relative degree constructions.

### Similarity and Equivalence

Early Hick marks similarity through two related constructions derived from 
Proto-Hick *kasu "reflection":

1. Simple Comparisons
   Uses the ka- prefix for straightforward comparisons with single nouns:
   ```plaintext
   kamales ward'er
   ADJ.pool.ABS contain.VERB
   "(It) contains like a pool"
   ```

2. Complex Comparisons
   Uses kas conjunction for phrases with modifiers:
   ```plaintext
   kas [kameris kethbranes] tagimris'er
   LIKE [ADJ.love kin.ABS] give.VERB
   "As beloved kin give"
   ```

### Relative Degree

Early Hick expresses relative degree through a specialized construction using 
spatial cases. The construction treats comparisons as stative predicates with 
two arguments:

1. Greater Than
   Uses the superessive case (-itar "upon/above"):
   ```plaintext
   tores tor'er malitar
   mountain-ABS height-VERB pool-SUPE
   "The mountain is taller than the pool"
   ```

2. Less Than
   Uses the subessive case (-asam "under/below"):
   ```plaintext
   males tor'er torasam
   pool-ABS height-VERB mountain-SUBE
   "The pool is less tall than the mountain"
   ```

[rest of the relative degree section as drafted before...]
````

This organization:
- Shows both comparison strategies clearly
- Maintains the historical/etymological information
- Makes the relationship between the constructions clearer
- Follows a logical progression from simpler to more complex structures

Would you like me to expand any part of this integrated structure?

---

_**User**_

I see your use of coordination in the Syntactic Properties section
```
tores tor'er [malitar ru kethitar]
```
I wonder if it would also be used in the formalized manner
tores tor'er [mal o keth ruitar]

---

_**Assistant**_



Ah, that's a great observation! Early Hick does have that formal coordination pattern with `o...ru`. Let me add this literary variant to the Syntactic Properties section:

````markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
// ... existing code ...

3. Multiple Comparators
   - Natural Pattern:
     ```plaintext
     tores tor'er [malitar ru kethitar]
     mountain-ABS height-VERB [pool-SUPE AND sea-SUPE]
     "The mountain is taller than both the pool and the sea"
     ```

   - Literary Style:
     ```plaintext
     tores tor'er [mal o keth ruitar]
     mountain-ABS height-VERB [pool PART sea AND-SUPE]
     "The mountain is taller than both the pool and sea"
     ```

   This literary innovation appears primarily in written texts and formal speech.

// ... existing code ...
````

This shows how the formal coordination pattern extends to comparative constructions, with the spatial case marker attaching to the coordinator `ru` rather than to each noun. Would you like me to explore other formal/literary variants of the comparative constructions?

---

_**User**_

or, like how japanese mo or toka work, this might just be how it works?

---

_**Assistant**_



Ah yes! That's a really good point. Like Japanese も (mo) or とか (toka), this could be the fundamental way that Early Hick handles coordination in comparisons, rather than being a special literary form.

Let's revise that section to show this as the basic pattern:

````markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
// ... existing code ...

3. Multiple Comparators
   - Uses the "o...ru" nominal coordination pattern with case marking on ru:
     ```plaintext
     tores tor'er [mal o keth ruitar]
     mountain-ABS height-VERB [pool PART sea AND-SUPE]
     "The mountain is taller than both the pool and sea"
     ```

   - Similarly for subessive comparisons:
     ```plaintext
     males tor'er [tor o keth ruasam]
     pool-ABS height-VERB [mountain PART sea AND-SUBE]
     "The pool is shorter than both the mountain and sea"
     ```

   The case marking attaches to the coordinator ru rather than to individual 
   nouns, following Early Hick's general coordination pattern.

// ... existing code ...
````

This makes more sense typologically and is more consistent with how Early Hick handles other coordinated constructions. Would you like to explore other aspects of how this coordination pattern interacts with comparisons?

---

_**User**_

btw, are there studies or sources that assert how japanese grammaticalized their coordinators mo and toka?

---

_**Assistant**_



Yes! There are several studies on the grammaticalization of Japanese particles. For も (mo) and とか (toka):

も (mo):
- Historically derived from Old Japanese もの (mono) "thing"
- Discussed in Narrog's "Modality in Japanese" (2009) and Traugott's work on grammaticalization
- Path: noun ("thing") > focus particle > additive/inclusive marker
- Similar paths seen in Korean 도 (do) and Mongolian ч (ch)

とか (toka):
- Relatively newer, grammaticalized from と (quotative) + か (question)
- Discussed in Suzuki (1998) "Pejorative Connotation: A Case of Japanese" 
- Path: quotative+question > exemplification > coordination
- Started as literary/formal, became colloquial in modern Japanese

Key sources:
- Narrog, H. (2009) "Modality in Japanese"
- Suzuki, S. (1998) "Pejorative Connotation: A Case of Japanese"
- Traugott, E. C. (2003) works on grammaticalization
- Makino & Tsutsui's "Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar" has good historical notes

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of these grammaticalization paths?

---

_**User**_

so it does make sense too that [X Y ... Z ru-CASE] was a formal form that colloquialized? I suppose through its use in oral tradition?

---

_**Assistant**_





Yes, exactly! That's a very plausible grammaticalization path for Early Hick's coordination pattern. We could hypothesize:

1. Original formal/ritual usage:
- Used in formal recitations
- Common in maritime/navigational contexts
- Part of ritual/sacred language
- Preserved in oral traditions

2. Path of change:
```
[X o Y o Z ru-CASE] 
(formal listing + summary marker with case)
↓
[X o Y ru-CASE]
(simplified but still formal)
↓
Common coordination strategy for complex phrases
```

This fits well with Early Hick's context because:
- Maritime terminology often preserves formal patterns
- Oral traditions tend to preserve older grammatical structures
- Sacred/ritual language influences everyday usage
- The pattern is efficient for listing multiple items

We could add a note about this to the historical development section:

````markdown:site/content/languages/hick/early-hick/_index.md
// ... existing code ...

The "o...ru" coordination pattern, originally a formal structure used in ritual 
recitation and maritime contexts, grammaticalized into the standard way of 
handling multiple items in case-marked positions. This development likely 
occurred through its frequent use in oral traditions, particularly in 
navigational and sacred contexts where precise listing of items was important.

// ... existing code ...
````

Would you like to explore more about how this pattern might have interacted with different registers or contexts in Early Hick?
