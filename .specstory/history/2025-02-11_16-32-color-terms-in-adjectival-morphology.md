## Color Terms in Adjectival Morphology (2/11/2025, 4:32:55 PM)

_**User**_

under adjectival morphology, let's add a subsection for color terms.

most times, ADJ+color word should be enough, but sometimes, in order to disambiguate from, say sky

for example, kakel can be sky-like, or blue

we can use -rak (from arak "color") kakelrak. this makes it unambiguous 
kakelrak kel
blue sky

'al'isel alises arak'er kelel kelrakes
I, who colored the sky blue

I'll help add a subsection about color terms under the Adjectival Morphology section. Here's the suggested addition:

### Color Terms

Early Hick forms color terms through two strategies:

1. Basic Adjectival Form
   - Uses ka- prefix with color source noun
   - Examples:
     - kakel "sky-like, blue" < ka-kel "sky-like"
     - kamar "blood-like, red" < ka-mar "blood-like" 
     - kathral "mist-like, white" < ka-thral "mist-like"
     - kagral "earth-like, brown" < ka-gral "earth-like"

2. Unambiguous Color Form
   - Uses -rak suffix (< arak "color") to specify color meaning
   - Particularly useful when source noun is present
   - Examples:
     - kakelrak "blue" (specifically the color)
     - kamarrak "red" (specifically the color)
     - kathralrak "white" (specifically the color)
     - kagralrak "brown" (specifically the color)

Compare:

```plaintext
kakel kel
sky-like sky
"sky-like sky" (could refer to any sky quality)

kakelrak kel
blue sky
"blue sky" (specifically about color)
```

The -rak suffix can also be used in color-changing contexts:

```plaintext
'al'isel alises arak'er kelel kelrakes
person.PROX.ERG who.ABS color.VERB sky.ERG blue.ABS
"I who colored the sky blue"
```

// ... existing code ...
````

This addition:
1. Explains both strategies for forming color terms
2. Shows how ambiguity is resolved
3. Provides examples of both basic and unambiguous forms
4. Demonstrates usage in color-changing contexts
5. Maintains consistency with the existing morphological patterns
