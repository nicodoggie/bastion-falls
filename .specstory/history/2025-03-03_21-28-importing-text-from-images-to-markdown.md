+ # Moreaux Island
+ 
+ An island within L'Illes Aggaric, Moreaux Island was made famous by reports of
+ a tribe of raiding cannibals residing within. Popularized by the much-republished
+ reports by noted anthropologist Dr. André Arquette, people in the Aggarian
+ Confederacy were stunned by the revelation that such a culture existed within
+ their midst.
+ 
+ Further attempts to communicate with the island's inhabitants had all ended in
+ tragedy. Most people were killed and eaten, as reported by a small number of
+ survivors.
+ 
+ ## Geography
+ 
+ The island itself is quite small with a radius of about 5 miles at high tide.
+ A coastline of about one mile is revealed when the tides recede, covered in a
+ mangrove forest. The shallow and rocky coastline makes it difficult for ships
+ to moor close to the ground and would make any visitor vulnerable to assaults.
+ 
+ ## Fauna
+ 
+ Most animals within Moreaux Island are small rodents that may burrow in the
+ ground and a few amphibious species that are insectivorous.
+ 
+ The mangroves are home to a number of insect communities and mollusks.
+ Migratory birds also often use the island as a resting ground.
+ 
+ ## Flora
+ 
+ Plants on the island are those that have adapted to a saline environment, like
+ mangroves and seagrass. Few of them are edible, but may help with seasoning,
+ and have some medicinal properties.
+ 
+ A number of edible mushrooms and lichen exist on the island, and are cultivated
+ by the natives for food and religious rituals. A specific red-capped mushroom
+ endemic to the island, in particular, is exclusively used for the rituals
+ associated with their cannibalistic practices.
+ 
+ ## Mundaguk People
+ 
+ Mundaguk people are what the natives call themselves in their local vernacular,
+ which seems to be related to Old Estagon in some respects. Colloquially, due to
+ the success of Dr. Arquette's book, they are known as the "Monsters of Moreaux
+ Island."
+ 
+ They are a single community of about 150 people at the time of their discovery
+ in 1269 AI who inhabit the island. They have limited seafaring abilities, but
+ do have rafts to fish in nearby atolls. Despite their popular depiction, a
+ careful reading of the text shows that their community is usually quite docile
+ until they are either confronted by an external threat such as interlopers, or
+ an internal power struggle. Both events seem to be fueled by the ingestion of
+ a local mushroom that enhances aggressive behavior and physical qualities.
+ 
+ Their weapons are quite basic offensive tools made from wood, rock and bone.
+ They have stone/flint knives, simple bows and arrows, clubs and other primitive
+ implements.

Some issues... Aggaric should likely be Apgarie. Aggarian should be Apgarian

I'll fix those spelling issues in the Moreaux Island markdown file.
